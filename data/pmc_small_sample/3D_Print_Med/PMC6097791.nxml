We developed an environment in our facility in which we can design, fabricate, and use 3D models called the &#x0201c;One-stop 3D printing lab&#x0201d;. The lab made it possible to quickly and inexpensively produce the 3D models that are indispensable for oral and maxillofacial surgery. We report our 3D model fabrication environment after determining the dimensional accuracy of the models with different laminating pitches (; layer thickness) after fabricating over 300 3D models. Considerations were made for further reducing modeling cost and model print time. MDCT imaging was performed using a dry human mandible, and 3D CAD data were generated from the DICOM image data.&#x000a0;3D models were fabricated with a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer MF-2000 (MUTOH) with a laminating pitch of 0.2&#x000a0;mm, 0.3&#x000a0;mm, 0.4&#x000a0;mm, or 0.5&#x000a0;mm. Each 3D model was then subjected to reverse scanning to evaluate the modeling conditions and deformation during modeling. For the 3D image processing system, Volume Extractor 3.0 (i-Plants Systems) and POLYGONALmeister V2 (UEL) were used. For the comparative evaluation of CAD data, spGauge 2014.1 (Armonicos) was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">As the laminating pitch increased, the weight of the 3D model, model print time, and material cost decreased, and no significant reduction in geometric accuracy was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The amount of modeling material used and preparation cost were reduced by increasing the laminating pitch.

The laminating pitch (layer thickness) and fill density (infill density) control the amount of modeling material used. While it is expected that an increase in laminating pitch will lead to a reduction in the modeling cost, there is concern that the precision will be lowered.</p><p id="Par16">In this study, we evaluated the dimensional accuracy of 3D models fabricated with different laminating pitches, aiming for a further reduction of modeling costs.

If inexpensively fabricating medical 3D models were to become possible, more needs could likely be met internally. The costs of the desktop 3D printer and the modeling materials are lower than those of professional 3D printers for industrial use. To promote the spread of 3D printers in the oral and maxillofacial surgery and dentistry fields, it is essential to accumulate knowledge about the modeling characteristics of 3D printers.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Experience using FDM 3D printers</title><p id="Par27">The results of this study show the increase in the lamination pitch means that the amount of filament to be used is reduced, resulting in shortening of model print time and reduction of cost. In recent years, 3D printers ranging from high-end printers for industrial use to low-end printers for personal use have appeared on the market. The biggest advantage of using the FDM 3D printer is that the purchase price of the equipment is low, maintenance costs are minimal, commonly used material is easy to obtain and is relatively inexpensive. Therefore, it is possible to minimize the cost of obtaining 3D models. Many of our fabricated 300 or more 3D models are PLA models with a laminating pitch of 0.3&#x000a0;mm and a fill density of 50%. We think that this setting has a good balance with the anatomical reproducibility we want, cost, and model print time. Models fabricated with PLA have high affinity with dental instruments and good technical workability, create a cutting feeling similar to actual bone, and can be easily used to perform the surgical simulation. In addition, it is easy to fabricate a plurality of models according to the purpose because of its low modeling cost. The disadvantages are the extrusion head of the printer must continue moving, or material bumps up and depending on the form of the 3D models, we often experience difficulties in laminating. As can be seen from this result, when distortion is expected when fabricating 3D models, in consideration of modeling direction and installation of support structures, in order to reduce deformation during the 3D CAD design stage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Structures fabricated as support materials (<italic>arrowheads</italic>). <bold>a</bold> To increase the contact area with the heating table of 3D printer, a plate-like support was installed. <bold>b</bold> To prevent deformation due to its own weight, a columnar support was installed</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41205_2018_28_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>&#x0201c;One-stop 3D printing lab&#x0201d; for oral and maxillofacial surgery and dentistry fields</title><p id="Par28">The &#x0201c;One-stop 3D printing lab&#x0201d; in imitation of the term &#x0201c;One stop shop&#x0201d; that is a business or office where multiple services are offered, is an environment that can complete everything from design to fabricating in our facility. One of the merits of the one-stop fabrication lab is that it is possible to fabricate the model while communicating with the surgeon to determine which parts are critical in the 3D model. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a&#x02013;g</xref> show our 3D modeling cases. Although the desktop/personal FDM 3D printer is often classified as low-end, it may be able to meet more expectations and allow for new developments in the oral and maxillofacial surgery and dentistry fields. However, even if the desktop/personal FDM 3D printer is introduced, it cannot be used immediately. To reproduce the different disease states in individual patients to be modeled, it is necessary to first understand the physical properties of the model, understand modality, master the software operation, and understand the dissections and readings. When we first began, 3D model creation was not quick and easy, it took significant time and effort to reduce the labor required and the number of processes in the flow from 3D CAD data construction to model output. Accumulation of know-how was a necessary part of the process.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Fabricated PLA 3D models used clinically with a laminating pitch of 0.3&#x000a0;mm and a fill density of 50%. <bold>a</bold> Precise reproduction of cystic lesions and tooth roots in the maxilla. <bold>b</bold> Used in pre-vending of reconstruction plate. <bold>c</bold> Used for preoperative evaluation of secondary reconstruction of the mandible. <bold>d</bold> Patient-specific 3D jaw bone model of a patient with a jaw deformity. <bold>e</bold> Model embodies the amount of maxillary movement and direction in Le Fort I osteotomy <italic>(white-arrow)</italic> and bone trimming of mandibular ramus (<italic>arrowhead</italic>). <bold>f</bold> Confirmation of interferences between mandibular proximal and distal segments for the mandibular setback in sagittal split ramus osteotomy (<italic>arrow</italic>). <bold>g</bold> Fixation plates in mandibular advancement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41205_2018_28_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par29">To fabricate highly accurate 3D models, it is necessary to understand the modeling characteristics of the 3D printer used. There are many control parameters that need to be set in the 3D printer software. A trial and error process was required until a stable print protocol could be constructed. The FDM 3D printer melts materials by heat and laminates layers from the bottom. Therefore, the object may tilt under its own weight depending on the 3D shape being fabricated, and it may fall off the forming table in the middle of modeling. This was rectified by adjusting the parameters of the 3D printer control software and developing creative structural solutions during the 3D CAD data creation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Future prospects</title><p id="Par30">Surgical simulations using a 3D model have been performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Mavili et al. posited that the limitations of this technology are manufacturing time and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but the desktop FDM 3D printer can solve these problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition to major surgery, such as bone dissection and orthognathic surgery, 3D models are also useful for treatment planning and simulation of minor surgery such as surgical endodontic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It has been reported that utilization of a low-end 3D printer advances the field of dental treatment, and endodontic management in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Dramatic evolution of 3D printing technology is expected to further aid the dentistry field. To utilize 3D printers in the clinical practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery and dentistry, it is necessary to consider the stomatognathic field, a subspecialty of the oral and maxillofacial field. The target organs in oral and maxillofacial surgery are the teeth and jawbones, which are relatively small compared with other organs. Therefore, higher spatial resolution modalities will be necessary to obtain detailed information. In addition, the response of metal artifacts to CT imaging, which are often encountered in daily diagnostic imaging, is also a serious problem. It is often difficult to obtain information on teeth and alveolar crest bones because of metal artifacts and/or beam hardening, which may lead to an increase in the number of image processing steps or a decrease in the accuracy of the modeled objects. The CBCT which has become popular in recent years may be useful from the viewpoint of higher spatial resolution and X-ray exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. If it becomes possible to obtain high-resolution data, it will be expected to be able to fabricate more detailed 3D models. However, significant metal artifacts and beam hardening are also recognized in CBCT images. Sometimes it is more than MDCT, we experienced difficulty in 3D modeling. Unfortunately, there are as yet no measures for preventing them. For certain dental applications, a method using a hybrid model that the dental cast can be scanned and then aligned with the CT scan has also been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, the current situation is difficult to operate, it is difficult to say easily. Furthermore, utilizing 3D optical devices without metal artifacts is considered to be a potential solution to this challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par31">The results obtained using the FDM 3D printer suggested that adjusting the laminating pitch may lead to further reduction of model print time and cost.
