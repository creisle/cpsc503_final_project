Optimisation of hydrolysis conditions for apple pomace hydrolysis using Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L was investigated using 1 L reaction volumes. The effects of temperature, pH, &#x003b2;-glucosidase supplementation and substrate feeding regimes were determined. Hydrolysis at room temperature using an unbuffered system gave optimal performance. Reactors in batch mode resulted in a better performance (4.2&#x000a0;g/L glucose and 16.8&#x000a0;g/L reducing sugar, 75&#x000a0;% yield for both) than fed-batch (3.2&#x000a0;g/L glucose and 14.6&#x000a0;g/L reducing sugar, 65.5 and 73.1&#x000a0;% yield respectively) in 72&#x000a0;h. The addition of Novozyme 188 to the core mixture of Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L resulted in the doubling of glucose released. The main products (yield %) released from apple pomace hydrolysis were galacturonic acid (78&#x000a0;%), glucose (75&#x000a0;%), arabinose (90&#x000a0;%) and galactose (87&#x000a0;%).

Large quantities of waste are produced worldwide every year, with 25&#x02013;35&#x000a0;% of the 70 million metric tonnes produced ending up as waste (Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>; Gullon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>), an estimated 17&#x02013;24 million metric tonnes per year (Van Dyk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>). In most cases, the pomace is disposed of, which poses major environmental and health problems due to its high moisture content (70&#x02013;75&#x000a0;%), high chemical oxygen demand (COD, 10,000&#x000a0;mg/L) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) (Bhushan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Capek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1995</xref>; Mahmood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>; Parmar and Rupasinghe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). Combining treatment of this waste with production of value-added products can solve disposal problems, while potentially creating additional revenue in the bio-economy.</p><p>Apple pomace is lignocellulosic in nature and a rich source of cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose, which can be enzymatically converted to sugar monomers and other value-added products such as acetic acid, galacturonic acid, phenolics, vanillin, etc. (Bhushan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Foyle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>; Joshi and Attri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>; Parmar and Rupasinghe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>; Vendruscolo and Ninow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>). Enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic substrates requires a number of enzymes, working in synergy. Cellulose degradation requires cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases and &#x003b2;-glucosidases. While hemicellulose and the enzymes required for its degradation have been studied, hemicellulose composition can be variable. In the case of apple pomace, the hemicellulose composition has not been studied and therefore it is not clear which enzymes are required. Some authors have indicated that apple pomace contains xylan (Bhushan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Dhillon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Parmar and Rupasinghe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>), which would indicate a requirement for endoxylanases and &#x003b2;-xylosidases, as well as possible debranching enzymes. However, the xylose found in apple pomace could also be present in the form of xyloglucan or xylogalacturonan. Le Bourvellec et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>) indicated that fucogalactoxyloglucan was the main hemicellulose in apple pomace. This could indicate a requirement for a completely different set of enzymes compared to xylan hydrolysis, for example xyloglucanases.</p><p>Apple pomace also contains high levels of pectin. However, studies on pectin degradation in complex substrates have been very limited. Pectin is highly complex and many enzymes have activity on pectin, for example methyl esterase, acetyl esterase, pectate lyase, pectin lyase, endo-polygalacturonase, exo-polygalacturonase, arabinase and galactanase (Van den Brink and de Vries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>; Voragen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>). Pectinases usually refer to the enzymes that cleave the backbone to release galacturonic acid, while arabinase and galactanase cleave the neutral side chains in rhamnogalacturonan I into neutral sugars, arabinose and galactose.</p><p>Commercially available enzyme cocktails contain multiple enzymes which act on lignocellulose, with different cocktails optimised for different substrates. As there are no ready-made cocktails for apple pomace degradation, we investigated combinations of cocktails which together would contain the enzymes required for its hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Apple pomace biomass preparation</title><p>Golden Delicious apples, obtained from a local supermarket, were cut into small pieces and the juice extracted using a domestic juicer to separate the pomace from the juice. The pomace was then homogenised in a food processor and washed several times with distilled water until no sugars were detected in the wash using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay (Miller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1959</xref>). The apple pomace was stored wet at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Apple pomace was used at various substrate loadings based on the wet weight, with dry weight equivalent approximately 10&#x000a0;% of the wet weight. The dry weight was determined by freeze-drying the apple pomace. Sodium azide (0.03&#x000a0;% w/v) was used as a microbial preservative in buffers and apple pomace.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Enzymes</title><p>Three commercial enzyme preparations were used in this study: Viscozyme L (&#x0201c;Viscozyme&#x0201d;) (an enzyme complex from <italic>Aspergillus aculeatus</italic>) (Sigma); Celluclast 1.5L (&#x0201c;Celluclast&#x0201d;) (a commercial <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> ATCC cellulase preparation) (Sigma); Biocip Membrane (&#x0201c;Biocip&#x0201d;) (Novozymes, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and Novozyme 188 (a commercial <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>&#x02014;&#x003b2;-glucosidase preparation).

There are only a few reports in literature which indicate the different enzymes which are present in Celluclast, with no studies reporting on the enzyme activities in Viscozyme. Suwannarangsee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>) identified the proteins in Celluclast using LC/MS/MS and identified two cellobiohydrolases, five endoglucanases, one xyloglucanase, two &#x003b2;-xylosidases and two endoxylanases. However, they did not identify any pectinases and mannanases, which were detected through activity assays in our study, although Kovacs et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>) reported the presence of mannanase and mannosidase activities in Celluclast. Suwannarangsee et al.

The enzyme ratio that resulted in the highest release of reducing sugars was V50:C50 (925.5 U/mg protein), followed closely by V62.5:C37.5 and V75:C25 with 889.2 and 865.7 U/mg protein, respectively (See &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>&#x0201d;, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The enzyme combination of V50:C50 was selected for all subsequent experiments, although the results indicated that sugar release was not very sensitive to the specific ratio of the enzyme mixtures employed.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Apple pomace composition</title><p>The composition of apple pomace was determined with respect to the main sugars and lignin. The amount of acid soluble lignin in apple pomace was 19.8&#x000a0;%, which fell in the range reported by other researchers, 15.2&#x02013;20.4&#x000a0;% (Bhushan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Nawirska and Kwasniewska <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>). With respect to the neutral sugars in apple pomace, glucose concentration was the highest at 22.3&#x000a0;%, followed by arabinose (12.5&#x000a0;%) and galactose (5.1&#x000a0;%). Very little xylose was detected (1.1&#x000a0;%), but our analysis did not identify whether this formed part of xylan or another polysaccharide such as xyloglucan. The amount of glucose, arabinose and galactose obtained were similar to results reported by other researchers (Bhushan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Joshi and Attri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>; Parmar and Rupasinghe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). The remainder (38&#x000a0;%) consisted mainly of galacturonic acid and other components in low concentrations, most likely ferulic acid, extractives, proteins, minerals and other sugars such as rhamnose which was not directly measured in our study. The HLPC method that was used in this study was unable to measure the galacturonic acid content directly, so that the actual percentage galacturonic acid could not be determined. The reported galacturonic acid content of apple pomace in the literature varies widely and we were unable to clarify this further, 49&#x02013;64&#x000a0;% (Bhushan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>) and 11.7&#x000a0;% (Nawirska and Kwasniewska <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>). None of the available methods for determination of lignocellulose composition in the literature have been developed for high pectin-containing substrates, making an accurate mass balance and calculation of yields for galacturonic acid difficult. The presence of starch in the apple pomace was also determined. There was no starch detected in the apple pomace.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Effect of temperature and pH (buffering) on apple pomace hydrolysis</title><p>Two of the most important reaction conditions for enzyme hydrolysis are temperature and pH. We first determined the temperature and pH optima for Celluclast and Viscozyme on apple pomace as a substrate and found that Celluclast and Viscozyme both displayed a broad pH range (data not shown). Viscozyme displayed optimal activity over a wide pH range of 3.0&#x02013;6.0, while Celluclast displayed optimal activity over a narrow range of pH of 3.0&#x02013;4.5. Viscozyme was very stable and had a residual activity of more than 80&#x000a0;% at pH 4.0, pH 5.0 and pH 6.0 after 24&#x000a0;h incubation, which decreased to around 60&#x000a0;% at pH 3.0. Celluclast had a residual activity of more than 80&#x000a0;% at pH 3.0&#x02013;6.0 after 24&#x000a0;h incubation, with the highest stability observed at pH 4.0. This indicated that the two mixtures will function effectively over a pH range between pH 3.0 and pH 6.0.</p><p>The temperature optima for both commercial enzyme preparations were 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (See &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>&#x0201d;, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). However, Celluclast had a broad temperature range from 25 to 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, while Viscozyme displayed a range of activity from 25 to 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with two peaks at 37 and 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, respectively. High levels of activity were present at the temperatures used in this study. With respect to stability, Viscozyme retained residual activity above 90&#x000a0;% after 24&#x000a0;h incubation at 20, 28 and 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. However, the residual activity decreased to about 60&#x000a0;% at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Celluclast maintained residual activity of above 90&#x000a0;% at 20, 28, 37 and 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, with the greatest stability observed at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. A combination of Viscozyme and Celluclast was more stable than the individual enzyme mixtures and displayed more than 90&#x000a0;% residual activity after 15&#x000a0;days at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and pH 5.0 (data not shown).</p><p>To determine the effect of buffering on apple pomace hydrolysis, the amount of reducing sugars released and the change in pH were measured over a period of 72&#x000a0;h using citrate buffer, tap water and deionised water and different temperatures. The results are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. There was a rapid release of reducing sugars during the first 6&#x000a0;h with the unbuffered reactions showing the highest levels, coinciding with a sharp decrease in pH observed during this time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Evaluation of the effect of temperature and pH.

Apple pomace 5&#x000a0;% (wet, w/v) (0.5&#x000a0;% dry w/v) was used as substrate in shake flasks of 1 L reaction volumes and was mixed by shaking on a platform shaker for 72&#x000a0;h.

Citrate buffer maintained the pH around pH 5.0, while in the case of tap water and deionised water, the pH dropped to around pH 3.6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The drop in pH in the unbuffered reactions can be attributed to the release of acids such as galacturonic acid from the pectin component. The higher levels of reducing sugars released in reactions (where the pH displayed a significant decrease) indicated that the multiple enzymes present in the mixture probably displayed activity at different pH values. The change in pH therefore seems to promote the activity of certain enzymes. This seems to be supported by the wide range in pH optima for the mixtures. Achieving the best result without buffering means that the costs associated with adding chemicals are significantly reduced.</p><p>The difference in results between tap water and deionised water is difficult to explain. One hypothesis is that the presence of metal ions in tap water that may have a stimulatory effect on the enzymes, e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and K (Ferchak and Pye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1983</xref>; Tejirian and Xu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2010</xref>). However, when the effect of metal ions was examined on enzyme activity, no enhancement in activity was found (data not shown).</p><p>Although the optima for the enzyme mixtures were 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the aim was to limit the energy and chemical inputs and associated costs and therefore decided to test the rate of hydrolysis at room temperature (no energy input, with fluctuations), 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (minimal energy input but constant temperature) and 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Our results also indicated that the enzymes displayed greater stability at lower temperatures. Reactions at all three temperature conditions did not display large differences in terms of reducing sugar release and pH (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and d) using an unbuffered system (i.e. tap water). The amount of reducing sugars released after 72&#x000a0;h at room temperature, 28 and 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C were 3.3, 3.6 and 3.5&#x000a0;g/L, respectively. Although the reaction at room temperature produced slightly lower amounts of reducing sugars, such conditions could still be effective for bioreactor applications, since no input of energy and cost associated with buffering was required, while still obtaining high levels of sugars. Depending on the value of the products produced in an industrial process, a temperature of 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C can still be implemented and reactions can be run for shorter times.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Effect of &#x003b2;-glucosidase supplementation</title><p>The effect of supplementing with additional &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity was determined by adding Novozyme 188 to the enzyme mixture at 10&#x000a0;% (protein weight) and comparing it to a reaction without Novozyme 188 supplementation.

After 200&#x000a0;h, the amount of glucose released with 10 and 10&#x000a0;%Nov increased to 2.1 and 4.7&#x000a0;g/L, respectively (See &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>&#x0201d;, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).

Our studies showed significant inhibition of Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L in the presence of cellobiose which indicates that end-product inhibition is an important factor (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), while the increased release of glucose in the presence of Novozyme 188 also confirms that &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity resulted in cleavage of cellobiose. Only a small difference in reducing sugars produced was observed in the two treatments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) indicating that Novozyme 188 supplementation had no effect on the release of reducing sugars.

The production of multiple sugars and galacturonic acid poses a challenge for bioethanol production as there is not a single organism capable of fermenting all these sugars. Glucose can be fermented to ethanol by <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic>, while arabinose, xylose and galacturonic acid can be fermented using genetically modified organisms, e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic> K011 and <italic>Erwinia</italic> species (<italic>E. crysanthemi</italic> EC16 and <italic>E. carotovora</italic> SR38) (Dien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>; Grohmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>; Kang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>). Galacturonic acid can also be utilised in the synthesis of tensioactive agents for pharmaceutical and cosmetic purposes, as an acid agent, and for the production of vitamin C (Baciu and Jordening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2004</xref>; Boluda-Aguilar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>; Pourbafrani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>). Arabinose can be used for diagnostics (in bacteriology); derivatised to 5-deoxy-L-arabinose, which has anti-Parkinson properties; and as a precursor of <sc>l</sc>-fructose and <sc>l</sc>-glucose that are used as sweeteners (Baciu and Jordening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2004</xref>). Xylose and glucose can also be utilised in the food industry in the production of food sweeteners, xylitol and sorbitol, respectively (Bhushan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Demirbas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>). However, there may be other sugars and products in the hydrolysate that were not measured and these may also add to the value of degraded apple pomace.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Influence of sugars and organic acids on Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L</title><p>The effect of sugars on the Viscozyme and Celluclast combination was measured to determine their possible impact on the hydrolysis performance and is displayed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Viscozyme and Celluclast (50:50 ratio) residual activity in the presence of different sugars (<bold>a</bold>); and different organic acids (<bold>b</bold>).

Activity was measured using 5&#x000a0;% (wet w/v) (0.5&#x000a0;% dry w/v) apple pomace as substrate.

For the Viscozyme:Celluclast (50:50) combination, all the sugars tested displayed a linear trend of inhibition with increased concentrations of the inhibitor, although arabinose and galactose displayed activation at very low concentrations. Cellobiose and xylobiose displayed greater inhibition compared to the monomers glucose, xylose, arabinose and galactose. At high concentrations (2&#x000a0;mM), activity was reduced to&#x000a0;&#x02248;40&#x000a0;% in the presence of cellobiose and xylobiose, while activity was about&#x000a0;&#x02248;50&#x000a0;% in the presence of glucose and xylose. The sugar concentrations in the bioreactor after 100&#x000a0;h hydrolysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) were above 2&#x000a0;mM (except for xylose) and therefore are inhibitory to the enzymes slowing down the hydrolysis process. However, these sugars are released gradually in the bioreactor as compared to the initially high amounts for inhibition studies plus additional sugars released during hydrolysis. Using &#x003b2;-glucosidase in 100&#x000a0;h bioreactor experiments, the inhibitory effect of glucose was minimised. In order to avoid inhibitory effect of the sugars on the enzymes during hydrolysis, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) can be implemented (Kang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>). Membrane bioreactors can also be used (Andric et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>; Baeyens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>).</p><p>Organic acids may be present in a bioreactor for different reasons. They may be produced through a fermentative pathway or through hydrolysis of the substrate&#x02014;for example galacturonic acid is released from the degradation of apple pomace degradation (Gullon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). If SSF and consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) bioreactors is used, then the organic acids released from fermentation can inhibit saccharifying enzymes. The organic acids may also inhibit microbial fermentation by inhibiting their growth and metabolism (e.g. formic acid and acetic acid have been reported to have an inhibitory effect on microbial fermentation) (Parmar and Rupasinghe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>). Butyric, acetic and citric acid only had a slightly inhibitory effect on enzyme activity, with activity remaining above 80&#x000a0;%, even at concentrations of 10&#x000a0;g/L. Activity of 70&#x02013;80&#x000a0;% was retained at the concentrations of galacturonic acid tested (1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;g/L). The results observed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, which showed a concentration of 6.6&#x000a0;g/L galacturonic acid released after 100&#x000a0;h hydrolysis, indicated there may have been some enzyme inhibition taking place. However, in enzyme hydrolysis the concentration of galacturonic acid increases gradually as compared to initially high concentrations for inhibition studies. The concentration of galacturonic acid in the inhibition studies increases above the initial concentrations due to extra galacturonic acid released by enzyme action. Malic, formic and lactic acid displayed the greatest inhibitory effect and the enzyme activity decreased to below 50&#x000a0;%, even at low concentrations of the organic acids (1&#x000a0;g/L). However, these acids will affect the hydrolytic enzymes in the bioreactor if SSF is used. Considering these results, separate hydrolysis and fermentation will be more ideal to prevent enzyme inhibition in industrial bioreactors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The obtained results indicated that hydrolysis of apple pomace using Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L can be successfully performed at room temperature without buffering, therefore lowering the operational costs involved in the treatment of this waste, while producing multiple products that can further contribute in value addition. &#x003b2;-glucosidase supplementation to Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L was very important as it resulted in the doubling of the amount of glucose released over longer periods of incubation. The best results were obtained by operating the bioreactors in a batch mode producing 4.2&#x000a0;g/L glucose and 16.8&#x000a0;g/L reducing sugar (75&#x000a0;% yield for both glucose and reducing sugar) compared to the fed-batch bioreactors. Apple pomace hydrolysis products such as glucose, galacturonic acid, arabinose and galactose (75, 78, 90, and 87&#x000a0;% yield, respectively) can be further explored for value addition, making the treatment process more cost-effective. This study revealed that there were multiple and complementary enzymes present in both the Viscozyme and Celluclast cocktails. Employing similar hydrolysis conditions for the enzymes allow for the cost-effective application in industrial bioreactors. The inhibitory effect of various sugars on Viscozyme and Celluclast can be minimised using a SSF or a membrane bioreactor system.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Appendix</title><p>See Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Activities (<italic>solid bars</italic>) and degree of synergy (<italic>line</italic>) of Biocip membrane (<italic>B</italic>), Viscozyme L (<italic>V</italic>) and Celluclast 1.5L (<italic>C</italic>) individually and their combinations (equal ratios) on 5&#x000a0;% (wet w/v) apple pomace after 1&#x000a0;h incubation at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.
