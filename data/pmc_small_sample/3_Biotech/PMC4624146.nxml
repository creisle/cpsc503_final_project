According to their dissociation in an aqueous solution, dyes can be classified as acid, direct reactive dyes (anionic), basic dyes (cationic) and disperse dyes (nonionic) (Mishra and Tripathi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1983</xref>). Many chemical dyes are being used increasingly in textile and dyeing industries because of their ease and cost effectiveness in synthesis, firmness and variety in colour compared to that of natural dyes (Mathur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). India&#x02019;s dye industry produces every type of dyes and pigments. Production of dyestuff and pigments in India is close to 80,000 tonnes per annum (Mathur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). India is the second largest exporter of dyestuffs and intermediates after China (Mathur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>).</p><p>The textile industry accounts for the largest consumption of dyestuffs, at nearly 80&#x000a0;% (Mathur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). According to the survey of the Ecological and Toxicological Association of the Dyestuffs Manufacturing Industry (ETAD), over 90&#x000a0;% of some 4000 dyes have LD<sub>50</sub> values greater than 2000&#x000a0;mg/kg (Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>) which is very dangerous to nature. Effluents from the textile industries containing dyes are highly coloured and are, therefore, visually identifiable (Kilic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>). The coloured effluents damage the aesthetic quality of water and soil and reduce light penetration and photosynthesis and also some of the dyes are toxic or mutagenic, carcinogenic and allergenic (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). Because of the widespread use and potential carcinogenicity of certain dyes, there has been a growing interest in assessing the hazards associated with dyes available in local markets and hence decoloration of the dye-bearing effluents is of great importance. Everything touched by king Midas turned to gold. By a sort of inversion process, everything that modern men touch turns to a waste product sooner or later. Wastes are usually discarded into water, with or without processing. At present, water is becoming a rare commodity, and the available water resources are inadequate to meet the essential needs of man. Improper disposal methods and inadequate control of toxic effluents from different industries have led to the widespread contamination of surface as well as groundwater and have made the water resources unfit for usage (Odum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1969</xref>).</p><p>The traditional physical or chemical decoloration methods including coagulation, flocculation, ion exchange, irradiation, precipitation, ozonation and adsorption or a combination of these methods have been used for dye removal from wastewaters (Akar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>). However, application of these methods is somewhat restricted due to some limitations such as operational costs, formation of hazardous by-products, intensive energy requirement (Padmesh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) and limited adaptability to a wide range of effluents (Fu and Viraraghavan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>). Dye removal from waste water by established waste water treatment processes are expensive and need careful application (Vandevivere et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1998</xref>). Furthermore, following anaerobic digestion, nitrogen-containing dyes are transformed into aromatic amines that are more toxic and mutagenic than the parent molecules (Ganesh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1999</xref>). To overcome these difficulties, microorganisms are being investigated for their potential to bleach dye-bearing effluents. Biotechnological approaches were proven to be potentially effective in treatment of this pollution source in an eco-efficient manner (Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>). Although many microorganisms belonging to different taxonomic groups of bacteria (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2005</xref>) and algae (Dilek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1999</xref>) have been reported for their ability to bleach different dyes, fungi, in particular, white-rot group are recognized for their superior capacity to produce extracellular lignolytic enzymes such as laccase (Lac), lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>; Praveen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>) which are highly oxidative and nonspecific in action and responsible for degradation and decoloration of a wide range of dyes (Aksu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>; Praveen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>). The capacity of organisms in bio-bleaching process of dye differs from one organism to another and is dependent on inherent capacity of the organism, growth conditions and structure of dye. This is quite evident from a comparative study (Baldrian and Snajdr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>) that five litter-decomposing fungi (LDF) and two reference white-rot cultures exhibited difference in rates of bio-bleaching of 4 dyes including RBB-19 in high nitrogen and high carbon (HNHC) medium. According to this study, the reference culture <italic>Trametes versicolor&#x000a0;</italic> and LDF <italic>Collybia dryophilia</italic> displayed the fastest degradation of the dye Poly B-411 whereas other cultures LDF X1 and X2 caused most rapid decoloration of RBB-19. Similarly, <italic>Stropharia rugosoannulata</italic> was found to decolorise efficiently anthraquinone dye Basic Blue 22 (Jarosz-Wilkolazka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>). In this study, we report the ability of <italic>S. ostrea</italic> to bleach the dye&#x02014;RBB-19 in medium and effluents from silk saree-weaving cottage unit in comparison to the reference culture <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic> whose potential in color removal of dyes was assessed earlier (Rojek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fungal cultures</title><p>The fungal cultures&#x02014;<italic>S. ostrea</italic> and <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic>&#x02014;were maintained on Koroljova-skorobogat&#x02019;ko medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1998</xref>) containing the following composition (g/l): 3.0 peptone, 5.0 glucose, 0.6 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4,</sub> 0.5 MgSO<sub>4,&#x000a0;</sub>0.4 K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4,&#x000a0;</sub>0.05 MnSO<sub>4,&#x000a0;</sub>0.001ZnSO<sub>4,</sub>&#x000a0;0.0005 FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 20.0 agar (pH 6.0).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dye characterization</title><p>RBB-19 is one of the dyes used for colouring textile fibers and was provided by a dyeing unit, Dharmavaram, Anantapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh, India.

At high pH the growth of both cultures was poor and even decoloration of dye was slow. Growth (data not shown) and decoloration proceeded in parallel at different pH. This is consistent with result of different white-rot fungi in a majority of studies (Kapdan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>; Asghar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>; Pallavi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>) that maximum growth of organisms and decoloration took place in acidic pH range. Decoloration of RBB-19 by both fungal cultures in the present study at different temperatures showed 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C as an optimum temperature. This is consistent with temperature optima of 30&#x02013;37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for decoloration mediated by mesophilic white-rot fungi (Renganathan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>; Pallavi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>).</p><p>Both cultures, <italic>S. ostrea</italic> and <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic>, exhibited the same optimal conditions for decoloration of the dye, RBB-19 in the present study. The optimal conditions for bio-bleaching of the dye by the same cultures were pH 5.0, temperature 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and glucose&#x000a0;and fructose&#x000a0;as the best carbon and peptone and urea&#x000a0;as the best nitrogen source. The best decoloration efficiencies (65&#x02013;80&#x000a0;%) of the dye were obtained when <italic>Trametes versicolor</italic> grown in nitrogen-limited conditions under aerobic conditions in a fed-batch study (Moreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>). <italic>Trametes pubescens</italic> completely removed colour of two anthraquinone dyes RBB-19 and B-49&#x000a0;in low-nitrogen minimal medium (LNMM) in bioreactor for 5 cycles with increasing concentration up to 1000&#x000a0;ppm.</p><p>Shaking was beneficial to decoloration of dye by the fungal cultures in particular to <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic> in the present study. Similar observations on decoloration of different dyes by a number of organisms, <italic>P. chrysosporium, Trametes</italic> spp, were made (Glenn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1983</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>).</p><p>The rate of decoloration of dye by both fungal cultures in the present study decreased with increase in the concentration of dye from 0.04 to 0.2&#x000a0;% in the medium. Growth of the both fungal cultures at high concentration used in the study was severely affected. An observation of inverse relationship between concentration of dye in the medium and decoloration is in agreement with results of other study (Jarosz-Wilkolazka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>) that higher concentration (600&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;mg/L) of reactive blue in the medium adversely affected both adsorption to mycelia and decoloration by <italic>Aspergillus ochraceus</italic> NCIM-1146. Fall in decolorizing activity of the fungal cultures at higher concentration of dye could be due to exhaustion of limited binding sites on biomass for adsorption even at lower concentration of dye.</p><p>Bleaching of color that appeared on mycelial mat of the cultures in the present study is probably due to involvement of lignolytic enzymes. Growth of <italic>S. ostrea</italic> in the presence of RBB-19 produced higher biomass (data not shown) and higher yields of lignolytic enzymes Lac, LiP and MnP than that of <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic> under conditions employed in the present study. In view of participation of lignolytic enzymes in decoloration, the presence of lignolytic enzymes in fungal cultures is routinely tested on decoloration assay with Poly 478 dye (Pointing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1999</xref>). Bleaching of RBB dye at high rate by <italic>S. ostrea</italic> in the present study could be attributed to its higher growth and its larger capacity to secrete lignolytic enzymes in higher titres. Evaluation of performance of the two cultures in shake flasks in removal of color from coloured waste water collected from a local cottage dying unit indicated that <italic>S. ostrea</italic> was more effective than <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic>.</p><p>Addition of 1&#x000a0;% glucose to waste water enhanced decoloration process whereas, increase in concentration of glucose results in decrease in decoloration. A similar observation was made that <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic> and <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic> required only additional labile carbon&#x02013;glucose in decoloration of anaerobically digested molasses spent wash (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the isolate <italic>S. ostrea</italic> is better than the reference culture <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic> for decolorization of reactive textile dye. Even though both cultures displayed the same and identical optimal conditions, <italic>S. ostrea</italic> secreted lignolytic enzymes in larger amounts. <italic>S. ostrea</italic> performed better than <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic> in removal of color from effluent.
