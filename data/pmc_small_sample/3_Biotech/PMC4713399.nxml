Due to high specificity and limited approach towards non-target organism, the extensive use of this pesticide as an alternate for organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, causing an eventual increase in environmental pollution. Five flubendiamide-resistant bacterial strains were isolated during the present study from agriculture soil considering previous history of pesticide application. Minimal inhibitory concentration of all the isolates showed strain SSJ1 was most efficient flubendiamide resistant organism. Biochemical tests and molecular sequencing of 16s rRNA was carried out which confirmed the isolate as <italic>Chryseobacterium indologenes</italic> strain SSJ1. UV&#x02013;visible spectrophotometer study revealed that 89.06&#x000a0;% initial pesticide was removed by the isolate at optimum temperature of 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and pH 7.0 with 5&#x000a0;days incubation period and is further confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Results of the present study however, suggest strain SSJ1 is most resistant to flubendiamide and can possibly be applied in the bioremediation of flubendiamide contaminated soils.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Flubendiamide</kwd><kwd>Phthalic acid diamide</kwd><kwd>Biodegradation</kwd><kwd><italic>Chryseobacterium indologenes</italic></kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pesticides pose wide variety of disturbances in aquatic as well as terrestrial organisms, which include morphological, behavioural or physiological disturbances (Xing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>; Mansour and Mossa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>; David et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). These xenobiotics, however, enter food chain and gain access into humans through biomagnifications (Ellgehausen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1980</xref>) thereby affecting physiological activities. Indiscriminate use of these pesticides renders a greater threat to living organisms as well as environmental sustainability. Many studies were undertaken which confirm the neurological, physiological disturbances due to pesticide toxicity (David et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>).</p><p>Recent years, formulating a new class of chemical with a potential for acting on specific pest posing no harm to non-targeted organism was of prime importance. One such Phthalic acid diamide class of pesticide flubendiamide (C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>22</sub>F<sub>7</sub>IN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>S) was reported to be effective against a broad spectrum of lepidopteran insect pest with a relatively low toxicity to non-targeted organisms (Sarkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). This formulation works by disrupting ion channels and thereby paralysing the muscle fibres of the gut (Nishimatsu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>), therefore, the larvae stops feeding and eventually dies from starvation (Ebbinghaus-Kintscher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>). Flubendiamide is been widely used in Indian agriculture system for cultivation of rice and cotton, to get protection from pests (Government of India, Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Agriculture and Cooperation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). Apart from these two crops, this pesticide is also been used in the cultivation of fruiting vegetables, stone fruit, corn, cotton, grape, okra, tobacco, etc. (EPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>).</p><p>Even though precisely targeted formulations of flubendiamide are expected to be safe for non-target organisms, yet, several recent studies have shown toxic potentials of flubendiamide on many non-target organisms. Neurotoxic potentials and morphological anomalies in <italic>drosophila melanogaster</italic> have been reported (Sarkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). Acute and joint toxicity of flubendiamide was reported by Wei et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>) on Chinese tiger frog <italic>Hoplobatrachus chinensis</italic> tadpoles. Alterations in protein metabolism of fresh water fish <italic>Labeo rohita</italic> have been reported by Nirmalakallagadda and Rathnamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). Disruption of enzyme activity in tropical soil after flubendiamide application was reported (Shrinivas and David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>). These findings not only provide enough scientific evidences for flubendiamide toxicity to non-target organisms, and also is undesirable with ecological perspective, and furthermore, its fate as serious environmental pollutant.</p><p>Present study aims to explore the available means of detoxifying this pesticide using possible ways. One such economic and eco-friendly way of achieving this is by bioremediation using native microorganisms. Bioremediation is a process of cleaning up of contaminated soils using biological means. This process ultimately aims towards forcing these native microbial populations to use contaminant (pesticide) as a source of carbon and nutrient for their growth and development (Islas-garcia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>). Furthermore, it is necessary to perform physicochemical characterisation of contaminated soil in order to find out whether the native microbial species is capable of degrading the pesticide by biostimulation. However, unfortunately, there is no literature available so far for the bioremediation of flubendiamide in submerged culture by native bacteria. Hence, the present work was carried out in order to attempt isolation of flubendiamide resistant bacteria from the contaminated soil and to evaluate the potentials of these isolates in degrading the pesticide. These bacterial isolates could then be used in future to ward off or to limit the concentration of flubendiamide in agriculture systems thereby preventing them from reaching non-target organisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and media</title><p>Flubendiamide (98&#x000a0;% pure) was procured from TATA Rallis Co India and other molecular biology reagents were bought from Sigma-Aldrich.

</p><p>The MIC of flubendiamide was studied for each of the bacterial isolate. Among five isolates, SSJ1 exhibited a maximum tolerance of up to 1000&#x000a0;mg/L. This strain was further selected and processed for the degradation studies of flubendiamide. Bacterial isolate SSJ1 was found to be yellow-pigmented Gram negative, non-motile rod. The freshly grown cultures showed positive results for indole production, oxidase, catalase, urease, protease while negative for nitrate reduction, glucose acidification, maltose assimilation and thereby presumably identified as <italic>Chryseobacterium</italic> sp. Since, identification of the isolate by biochemical tests lead to unclear results, molecular characterisation was carried out by partial sequencing of 16s rRNA gene. The homology of a partial sequence with that of from NCBI database was compared and confirmed the identity of a strain as <italic>Chryseobacterium indologenes</italic> and it was designated and submitted to genbank as <italic>C.</italic>
<italic>indologenes</italic> strain SSJ1 with the accession number KP406152.</p><p>Growth kinetics and degradation profile was studies successively following the characterisation of efficient flubendiamide strain. MS media and nutrient broth were used to study the growth kinetics of the strain SSJ1. Media was inoculated with strain SSJ1 and amended with 100&#x000a0;mg/L flubendiamide concentration, and the isolate utilised the flubendiamide as a sole carbon and nitrogen source (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Growth was also observed in nutrient broth which showcased an elevated growth pattern in presence of necessary nutrients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Enhancement in the culture growth was observed when flubendiamide was an additional carbon source in nutrient broth. This indicates presence of additional carbon source could be a counter selective to the organism that used flubendiamide for its growth. Our study is in agreement with Jayanthi and Srujana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>) who studied degradation capability of <italic>A. xylosoxidans</italic> strain JAS11 in degrading 1000&#x000a0;mg/L malathion in MSM and nutrient broth. Similar study was carried out by Bhalerao and Puranik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>) with fungal isolate <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> for the degradation of monocrotophos.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Growth pattern of <italic>Chryseobacterium indologenes</italic> strain SSJ1 in MSM (<bold>a</bold>), Nutrient broth (<bold>b</bold>), in presence and absence of flubendiamide</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2015_347_Fig1_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p>During field application of the pesticide, the environmental conditions with respect to pH and temperature vary greatly and are almost impossible to attain a defined state. The degradation potential of the strain SSJ1 therefore was studied in culture media with varying physical parameters such as pH and temperature. At pH 5.0 and temperature 30&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, pesticide scavenging ability of strain SSJ1 followed steady path of decrease of 9.9, 15.79, 27.7, 40.0 to 41.4&#x000a0;% at day 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Temperature and pH of 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 7.0 are considered ideal for optimal growth of bacteria. Concentration of flubendiamide exhibited rapid decent of 52&#x000a0;% on day 3 and 79&#x000a0;% on day 4 as compared to control. Further, at day 5, the initial concentration went from 100 to 9.5&#x000a0;mg/L which accounts for the removal of about 89.1&#x000a0;% of the initial pesticide concentration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Further, it was confirmed by HPLC analysis with flubendiamide standards (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The fifth day sample showed little or no peak, and this could be interpreted as analytical evidence for the bio removal of flubendiamide.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Biodegradation pattern of flubendiamide in submerged cultures. <italic>Light coloured bars</italic> show flubendiamide concentration, <italic>dark coloured bars</italic> indicate control (without inoculation), and <italic>line</italic> shows biomass. <bold>a</bold> 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, pH 5.0; <bold>b</bold> 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, pH 7.0; <bold>c</bold> 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, pH 8.5</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2015_347_Fig2_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

</p><p>However, increase in temperature up to 40&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and high basicity followed almost similar trend as with neutral pH and 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with about 24.4&#x000a0;mg/L pesticide at day 5 which almost 71&#x000a0;% decrease with control from initial load (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Temperature and pH had a significant effect on degradation of flubendiamide. It was observed that neutral pH and optimum temperature of 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C contributed more in bringing down the pesticide concentration whereas, more acidic and more basic conditions hindered the growth of bacteria and thus reduced their efficiency in scavenging the pesticide. Similar effect was observed with respect to temperatures at 30 and 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The development and use of different formulations of pesticides in control of pests of agriculture importance have a nugatory effect on environmental sustainability and majority of these mainly reach non-target sites thus entering into food chain as well. Repeated applications of these pesticides have lead to the inception of resistant microorganisms and these microbes both bacteria as well as fungi can be isolated from these contaminated fields. In this work, flubendiamide resistant bacteria were isolated and tested for their degrading capabilities. Among five effective isolates, strain SSJ1, identified as <italic>C. indologenes</italic> showed maximum resistance of up to 1000&#x000a0;mg/L flubendiamide and degraded about 89.06&#x000a0;% of initial pesticide in 5&#x000a0;days incubation. HPLC reading are confirmative for this removal of pesticide as there was no peak elevation when compared with standards. Further studies are needed to assess effect of consortia on degradation, as well as some research on possible gene responsible for the degradation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors wish to thank
