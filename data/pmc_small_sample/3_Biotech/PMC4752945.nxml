Several classes of fungi have been studied to carry out this process to some extent, but overall the process remains inefficient. We have isolated a novel alkalophilic dimorphic lignin-degrading Deuteromycete from soil, identified as &#x0201c;uncultured&#x0201d; and coded as MVI.2011. Supernatant from 12-h culture of MVI.2011 in optimized mineral medium containing lignin pH 9.0 was analysed for Lignin Peroxidase, Manganese Peroxidase and Laccase. Enzyme purification was carried out by standard protocols using ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by further purification by Gel Permeation Chromatography. Analysis of total protein, specific enzyme activity and molecular weight of the GPC-purified LiP, MnP and Laccase showed 93.83&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, 5.27 U/mg, 42&#x000a0;kDa; 78.13&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, 13.18 U/mg, 45&#x000a0;kDa and 85.81&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, 4.77 U/mg, 62&#x000a0;kDa, respectively. The purified enzymes possessed high activity over a wide range of pH (4&#x02013;11), and temperature (30&#x02013;55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). The optimum substrate concentration was 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of lignin for all the three enzymes. CD spectra suggested that the predominant secondary structure was helix in LiP, and, turns in MnP and Laccase. The breakdown products of lignin degradation by MVI.2011 and the three purified enzymes were detected and identified by FTIR and GC&#x02013;MS. They were oxalic acid, hentriacontane, derivatives of octadecane, nonane, etc. These vital compounds are certain to find application as biofuels, an alternate energy source in various industries.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-016-0384-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Laccase</kwd><kwd>Lignin</kwd><kwd>Lignin peroxidase</kwd><kwd>Manganese peroxidase</kwd><kwd>MVI.2011</kwd><kwd>Biofuels</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fungi are well-known microorganisms found to degrade lignin and have been extensively studied (Evans and Hedger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2001</xref>; Hatakka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>). White rot fungi are believed to be the only and most effective degraders of lignin which comprise of several hundred species of Basidiomycetes and a few species of Ascomycetes. They are capable of degrading lignin component of wood completely to CO<sub>2</sub> and water. Of late, more diverse and taxonomically distinct fungi have been studied for their lignin-degrading capacity and brought under the purview of useful application in effluent treatment from various pulp and paper industries (Sahadevan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>). White rot fungi contain specific enzymes Lignin Peroxidase (LiP), Manganese Peroxidase (MnP), Laccase, and hydrogen peroxide-generating enzymes. Along with these enzymes, ROSs (Reactive oxygen species) is also considered to be an important agent for wood decay by fungi. Various combinations of these enzymes are produced by different fungi which suggest different mechanisms of lignin degradation (Sahadevan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>).</p><p>So far ligninolytic enzymes have been known to be produced by various fungi including <italic>T. versicolor</italic>, <italic>Phlebia fascicularia</italic>, <italic>Dichomitus squalens</italic>, <italic>Daedalea flavida</italic>, <italic>Phlebia floridensis and P. Radiate</italic> (Arora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2002</xref>), but most of them have failed to bring about efficient degradation of lignin at the high pH of pulp paper and such other industrial effluents. Literature survey shows that in general, fungi require a minimum of 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks for growth and production of extracellular lignin-degrading enzymes. They also prefer lower pH (4&#x02013;7) and temperature for lignin decomposition activity (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>). No single organism has been reported to produce all three enzymes, and, in equal proportions (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2001</xref>).</p><p>MVI.2011, a novel dimorphic alkalophilic fast-growing Deuteromycete was isolated and reported to degrade lignin, melanoidin and dyes (Thankamani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2002</xref>; Dev and Thankamani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>). The strain isolated and identified resembles <italic>Mycelia sterilia</italic> in several of its morphological properties and functional characterization; however, further study had to be carried to ascertain its exact species. The unique properties of strain MVI.2011 secreting a variety of enzymes, long shelf life at ambient temperatures, non-sporing nature, rapid growth, and highly alkalophilic nature open up a huge potential for large-scale application of the fungus to treat industrial effluents from pulp paper, distillery, and dye industry. The present study describes the purification and characterization of lignin-degrading enzymes, LiP, MnP and Laccase from MVI.2011 to provide a suitable biological alternative to treat highly alkaline effluent such as pulp and paper industry waste water in particular. We also identified key products obtained by the degradation of lignin by MVI.2011 and three purified enzymes (LiP, MnP and Laccase) which could have potential application as alternate energy source in industries like food processing, biofuels, etc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Organism</title><p>MVI.2011, an alkalophilic fungus reported to degrade melanoidin and remove colour from molasses-based distillery spent wash maintained on SDA slopes at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, was used for this work (Thankamani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Flask setup</title><p>A pure single colony of MVI.2011 was inoculated into 250&#x000a0;ml of the previously optimized modified mineral medium (mineral salts&#x02014;0.01&#x000a0;% each of sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate and magnesium sulphate, 0.5&#x000a0;% peptone, 1&#x000a0;% glucose and 0.1&#x000a0;% of lignin, pH 9.0) and incubated at ambient temperature for 12&#x000a0;h.

<sup>4</sup>. They have reported that <italic>Phlebia</italic> spp. was capable of producing LiP, MnP and Laccase and gave much higher degree of lignin degradation in comparison to <italic>P. Chrysosporium</italic> (most studied fungus). It has been reported by Galliano et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1991</xref>) that in lignin degradation by <italic>Rigidoporous lignosus</italic>, organism does not produce LiP but synthesizes MnP and Laccase. Results also showed that when two enzymes were purified and used in vitro to study their activity, neither enzyme was active independently but when both enzymes were used simultaneously lignin solubilisation was extensive. This shows the synergistic mechanism of their action. Eggert et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1996</xref>) have reported many natural Laccase mediators such as 3-hydroxy anthranilic acid though experimental data are lacking with respect to their role in lignin biodegradation (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2001</xref>).</p><p>The fungus MVI.2011 used in the present study was found to express all the three extracellular ligninolytic enzymes with appreciable enzymatic activity. However, the exact mechanism of their enzymatic activity has not been understood. In addition to the LiP, MnP and Laccases many other enzymes could be operating in bringing about rapid and almost total lignin utilization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conformation of purified enzyme proteins</title><p>The circular dichroism spectral study was performed for the three enzymes (LiP, MnP, and Laccase) to obtain some preliminary information on the enzymes protein conformational changes during reaction with substrate. CD spectra suggested that the predominant secondary structure was alpha helix in LiP, and &#x0201c;turns&#x0201d; in MnP and Laccase. CD studies are considered to be important for studying the secondary structure of proteins. The spectral profile of native LiP, MnP and Laccase between 200 and 260&#x000a0;nm recorded in the far-UV (200&#x02013;260&#x000a0;nm) region is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The dichroic band at 210&#x000a0;nm is seen clearly in all three enzymes characteristic of a-helical structure. As is apparent from the CD spectra the profile of LiP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;0.1&#x000a0;% lignin and Laccase&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;0.1&#x000a0;% lignin is somewhat similar to the native enzymes, respectively; however, changes are contrasting in case of MnP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;0.1&#x000a0;% lignin and its native enzyme. Upon interaction with the lignin, a reduction in intensity is seen indicating minor changes contributing to the changes in the protein conformation compared to its free state. In case of LiP, there was almost sixfold (approx. 400&#x000a0;%) increase in the a-helical and threefold increase in &#x0201c;turns&#x0201d; while b-sheets and random structure completely disappeared. In case of MnP, a-helical structure completely disappeared while there was 47.62&#x000a0;% decrease in the &#x0201c;turns&#x0201d;. B-sheets and random structures appeared in the MnP after interaction with lignin. In case of Laccase, there was 29.7&#x000a0;% increase in the a-helical and 14&#x000a0;% decrease in the &#x0201c;turns&#x0201d;, while no b-sheets or random structure were found in Laccase both in its native state and upon interaction. The study of enzymes from MVI.2011 showed that they contained predominantly helix structure. Here the CD data might suggest change in topo chemistry and conformational changes with respect to the affinity of the enzyme for its specific substrate. Lignin is a complex molecule and no optical activity reported in this study (Data not shown). Therefore, it is speculated that lignin though does not have a CD spectra of its own, but on interaction with the enzymes, it does modulate the conformation of three enzymes which might affect its activity. To the best of our knowledge, CD spectral data on purified lignin-degrading enzymes from lignin-degrading microbes before and after complex formation with specific substrates have not been reported before. The changes observed in MVI.2011 LiP, MnP and Laccase enzyme studies can provide a tool to understand the structure and mechanism of action of these enzyme but further studies are required to reach a firm conclusion.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Far UV-CD spectral analysis of pure enzymes: LiP (<bold>1a</bold>), MnP (<bold>2a</bold>) and Laccase (<bold>3a</bold>); pure enzymes in the presence of substrate lignin (<bold>1b</bold>, <bold>2b</bold>, <bold>3b</bold>); and changes in the secondary structure of three enzymes in the presence of lignin (<bold>1c</bold>, <bold>2c</bold>, <bold>3c</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_384_Fig2_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

Activity was found to increase with rise in pH of reaction mixture indicated by higher reduction in lignin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). This observation was remarkable since the organism could grow over a wide range of media with initial pH 4&#x02013;12. The optimum pH used for culture was pH 9.0. At the end of 18&#x000a0;h, the pH of growth medium fell sharply with concomitant increase in biomass. The culture supernatant or the crude enzyme had a low pH and could be directly assayed for LiP, MnP and laccase at pH 3.5&#x02013;5.0 as per prescribed standard protocols for ligninolytic enzymes. The purified MVI.2011 enzyme was stable and active at all pH 4&#x02013;11 with the highest activity at pH 8&#x02013;11.

</p><p>There are many reports on molecular characterization, influence of pH and temperature on stability and catalytic activity of ligninolytic enzymes, both crude as well as partially purified, from various genera and species of fungi. Regarding the chemical nature it has been proved that LiPs are glycoproteins with an average molecular weight of 38&#x02013;46&#x000a0;kDa. Detailed studies of enzyme intermediates of LiP and their steady-state and transient state kinetics have shown that these enzymes have their intermediates analogous to the other peroxidases (Renganathan and Gold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1986</xref>; Tien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1986</xref>; Andrawis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1988</xref>; Marquez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1988</xref>; Harvey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1989</xref>; Wariishi and Gold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1990</xref>; Cullen and Kersten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>). Reports by Edwards et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1993</xref> showed that LiP had maximum activity at pH 3.0 and increase in pH caused decrease in activity which has been attributed to the disruption of hydrogen bond formed between heme propionate an aspartic acid residue thereby resulting in complete inactivation of enzyme beyond pH 5. Raghukumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">(1999)</xref> and Tien and Kirk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1984)</xref> on <italic>Flavodon flavus</italic> and <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic>, respectively, have proved the acidic pH optimum of LiP. Report by Ahammed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">(2002)</xref> on the stability study of crude LiP showed that the enzyme was stable for 2&#x000a0;h at pH 2&#x02013;5 but gradual loss in activity was found with increase in pH to 6 and at higher pH, activity was completely lost. However, contrasting reports (Tuisel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1990</xref>) were obtained on LiP stabilities at different pH from <italic>P. chrysosporium</italic> which suggested that though low pH favoured higher activity, stability increased as pH was increased. Ahammed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">(2002)</xref> showed that temperature optimum of LiP was found to be 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and higher temperature beyond 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C resulted in the gradual inactivation of LiP. He reported that LiP enzyme activity was retained for a maximum for 2&#x000a0;h over a wide range of temperatures from 20 to 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C but higher temperature of 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C caused gradual loss in activity. Regarding MVI.2011, though the fungus was isolated from soil from Kerala, India with atmospheric temperatures varying from 28 to 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the highest growth was found at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in laboratory-controlled conditions. When the extracellular enzymes are isolated from the genetically controlled regulated cell system and purified, the optima of the pure proteins need not be the same as those for growth with respect to physical properties and/or physiological parameters. This was observed and confirmed by experiments during the initial isolation, screening and preliminary optimization studies (unpublished data, Thankamani 1995). At 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C enzymatic activity of separated and partially purified enzyme proteins ranged from 45 to 50&#x000a0;%. Increase in temperature of incubation of enzyme&#x02013;substrate mixture increased enzyme activity. Assay temperature of 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was chosen as the optimum for all 3 enzymes put together since they demonstrated very marked (80&#x02013;90&#x000a0;%) lignin degradation at this temperature. Tuisel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1990</xref>) had also shown time-dependent loss of LiP activity in <italic>P. Chrysosporium.</italic> At 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C the activity was lost completely after 6&#x000a0;h. Farrell et al.

<italic>BKM</italic>-<italic>1767</italic> and found that they had different iso-electric points between pI 4.7 and 3.3 and molecular weights were found to be between 38 and 43&#x000a0;kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE.</p><p>Almansa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>) showed that Laccase had an average molecular mass of 62&#x000a0;kDa and the iso-electric point to be pH 7 though Laccase had optimum pH of 3.0. Similarly Mabrouk et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>) reported that marine fungal isolate <italic>Trematosphaeria mangrovei</italic> showed higher Laccase activity at pH 4.5 after 14&#x000a0;days of growth while other two ligninolytic activities were not detected. Saito et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2003</xref>) who isolated and characterized Laccase-producing fungus from soil demonstrated that the iso-electric point (<italic>pI)</italic> of the enzyme was 3.5 and had a molecular mass of approximately 73&#x02013;80&#x000a0;kDa. The results were similar to the Laccase obtained from Basidiomycete PM1 and white rot fungus <italic>Marasmius quercophilus</italic> which also had an acidic iso-electric point (Dedeyan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>; Coll et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2001</xref>). There have been reports by Mishra et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>) who isolated Laccase enzyme from white rot fungal strain (WRF-1) in the economical medium containing synthetic dyes, ground nut shell (GNS) and performed morphological and biochemical analysis. WRF-1 strain was found to decolourize synthetic dyes efficiently at pH 5.0 and 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C temperature. The enzyme was purified by chromatography and the molecular mass was found to be 70&#x000a0;kDa by SDS-PAGE. The iso-electric point was found to be 4.8. Spectrophotometer studies showed that the dye was decolorized after 6&#x000a0;days of fermentation. Temperature was considered to be an important factor in controlling composition reaction by affecting microbial metabolism (Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2007</xref>). Liang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2003</xref>) also have reported that increased temperature tends to enhance the microbial activities.</p><p>Many classes of effluents discharged from the industries are alkaline in nature owing to the various chemical processes involved. The temperature of the effluents emanating from the industries is also high enough to cause the natural degradation almost impossible. So far, not many reports on biological systems are available which can operate at high pH and temperature of the effluent discharged. So as to carry out the treatment process, the pH has to be reduced considerably either by acid treatment which is more hazardous when discharged into the river or by dilution which adds to its water-intensive nature. The temperature of effluent though gets reduced as it passes through the pipe system and finally discharged, it is still high enough, degradation of which would normally require extra energy to be spent to cool down for normal degradation process. Effluents can be detained in large open tanks for bringing down the temperature before being led to the bioreactor. But cooling to any temperature less than the average ambient temperatures (30&#x02013;37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) prevalent in most parts of India demands lot of electric power; hence, is not a pragmatic or feasible idea as far as industries (distillery, paper pulp, textile, etc.) are concerned. This cost of energy is not viable for the industries, thereby seeking biological system which could act at high temperature and pH and bring about the degradation without involving the costly system is the objective. The study of MVI.2011 culture and purified enzymes obtained from MVI.2011 showed that the optimum enzyme activity of these enzymes was found to be at alkaline pH and at temperature around 30&#x02013;37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C which is also the average temperature of most parts of the India. Therefore, it can be used directly for the treatment of paper effluent waste obviating the need for dilution and hence more suitable for continuous operation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>FTIR</title><p>Infrared spectra can yield valuable information regarding the chemical groups present in a compound.

Main peaks found were broad and strong peak assigned to stretching vibration of aromatic and aliphatic &#x02013;OH (&#x003bd;(O&#x02013;H&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;O) in lignin at around 3500&#x02013;3300&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, intense peak assigned to ketones (&#x003bd;(C=O) symmetric stretch) at around 1638&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, weak peak assigned to ether (&#x003bd;(O&#x02212;C) stretch) at around 1080&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. A very weak peak corresponding to stretching vibration of C&#x02013;H stretch in CH<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub> group of lignin structure was found at around 2930&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> which appeared in lignin and disappeared after being acted upon by the MVI.2011. The peaks in the finger print region between 1800 and 600&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were observed and most notably around 1400&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> which are often attributed to the lignin components since it arises due to the aromatic skeletal vibration (C=C) in the lignin.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>

</p><p>FTIR analysis of lignin degradation with purified enzymes viz. LiP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), MnP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d) and Laccase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e) showed almost similar peak vibration. Important peaks were assigned to: a very strong and broad peak at around 3500&#x02013;3300&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (&#x003bd;(O&#x02013;H&#x000b7;&#x000b7;&#x000b7;O) stretching) assigned to stretching vibration of aromatic and aliphatic &#x02013;OH(alcohol) in lignin, intense peak around 1640&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>(&#x003bd;(C=C) symmetric stretch) assigned to ketones and medium intensity peak ascribed to aromatic stretch (&#x003bd;(C&#x02013;C) conjugated with C=C) at 1402&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and peaks of variable intensity were found around 1080&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> assigned to ether (&#x003bd;(O&#x02013;C) stretch). All three enzymes showed almost similar pattern of peak with some differences in the peak intensity which might suggest that lignin degradation pathway by three enzymes shares similar breakdown pathway. The peak at around 1402&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> remained almost constant upon degradation by the three enzymes; however, the intensity reduced when the lignin breakdown occurred by MVI.2011 showed that these three enzymes might not be responsible for breakage of aromatic ring. The variable intensity of the peak at around 1080&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> means that &#x02013;O&#x02013; asymmetric stretching vibration in the ether bond and the C&#x02013;O stretching vibration also showed some variation upon being acted by the MVI.2011 and three purified enzymes. This might be due to the generation of more easily degradable materials after the oxidation and demethylation of lignin side chain (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>).</p><p>Detailed study and analysis of culture supernatants at very close time intervals need to be carried out to understand and affirm the sequential appearance and disappearance of functional groups to identify formation of intermediates and end products of metabolic breakdown of lignin by MVI.2011. It may be surmised that in a system where whole cells are used or in a natural process, in addition to the three enzymes studied some other enzymes secreted by the microorganism could work synergistically by oxidative pathways to mineralise lignin completely into carbon dioxide and water under optimum conditions. Careful analysis of the spectral peaks showed that though similar functional groups appeared both in MVI.2011 culture broth and in purified isolated MVI enzyme-treated lignin a mild shift in the peaks was observed. The identification of the functional groups in the lignin-degraded products corresponded to the breakdown products identified by the mass spectrometry. In a similar finding by Yang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2010</xref>), the white rot fungi generated a great amount of conjugated and unconjugated C=O which may be due to oxidative mechanism involved in lignin biodegradation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>GC&#x02013;MS studies</title><p>The breakdown products released from the lignin degradation by three purified enzymes (LiP, MnP, Laccase) produced by MVI.2011 were analysed by GC&#x02013;MS.

</p><p>The number of peaks in the TIC pattern increased significantly after being treated with MVI.2011 and three purified enzymes compared to control. Many low molecular compounds, which could not be identified in the control, were identified following degradation of lignin by the three MVI.2011 enzymes. They were oxalic acid, 6-ethyloct-3-yl isobutyl ester; hentriacontane; 1-hexanol, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl); 1R,2C,3T,4T-tetramethyl-cyclohexane; alpha cubebene; octadecane, 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl and nonane, 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethyl. The compounds like oxalic acid derivative compounds identified in this study are guaiacol related which might be produced due to the oxidation of guaiacyl units present in the precursor coniferyl alcohol. These precursors along with syringyl units from precursor sinapyl alcohol form the basic moieties that are essential components of lignin structure (Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2013</xref>). A report by Kingsley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>) showed organic acid production by fungus <italic>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</italic> in which important organic acids produced were malonic acid and oxalic acid as shown in the present study. However, present study did not clearly reveal any syringyl-related compounds. Aromatics compounds and some aldehyde-ketone type compounds were identified due to degradation of lignin and this is well in accordance with the FTIR result. The identification of low molecular weight compounds in the extract of MVI.2011 culture and ones treated with three enzymes favours the conclusion that lignin was efficiently degraded by this novel organism. The complex of lignin breakdown product is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. It is noteworthy that most of the compounds produced can find suitable application in the alternative industry and most importantly as an important product for use as a biofuel. Oxalic acid derivative is an important component of dyeing industry: used as mordant and also used as a component in baking powder (Riemenschneider and Tanifuji <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>). Cubebene and its iso-forms have been used as an important component of herbal formulations and have recently drawn attention of the researchers for their neuron protective effect (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>). However, how far these compounds produced by lignin degradation using this novel organism can find application as an alternative medicine or in other industries is yet another area worth exploring. Higher alkanes like octadecane, nonane produced from lignin as by-products upon degradation are some of the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil (Wackett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>). Fungal breakdown of lignin by MVI.2011 into such alkanes could be part of humus in the natural degradation occurring in the soil ecosystem. A class of degradation products of recalcitrant dyes by white rot fungus was recently reported by Mishra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">(2011)</xref> and some findings about the degradation products were also reported by Telke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">(2010</xref>) in case of <italic>Aspergillus ochraceus</italic> NCIM-1146. The degradation products find important application in industries and specific products like dodecane has recently generated a considerable amount of attention as a potential surrogate fuel for application in Jet fuels. The application potential of lignin bio-products in several industries like food and flavour industry and chemical industries can be enhanced if the bio-catalytic breakdown of lignin could be harnessed and controlled. A more protracted in-depth qualitative analysis of the innumerable products in the MVI 0.2011 culture supernatant might reveal presence of valuable lignin by-products which have application in the food industry. These data illustrate the potential of novel fungus MVI.2011 in conversion of lignin to value-added chemicals; however, large-scale production of such value-added products continues to be a challenge.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Complex of lignin breakdown products by MVI.2011 and three purified enzymes: LiP, MnP and Laccase as identified in the GC&#x02013;MS.

</p><p>Regarding the mechanism of lignin degradation, it is reported that hydrogen peroxide is an important requirement for oxidation by LiP and MnP enzymes. In case of several white rot fungi including <italic>P. chrysosporium,</italic> this requirement is met by extracellular oxidases that reduce molecular oxygen into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and thereby oxidizing the co-substrate. One such extracellular enzyme involved in peroxide production is glyoxal oxidase (GLOX) (Kersten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1990</xref>). According to the unpublished data (by V Thankamani and TR Sreekrishnan), it was shown that fungus MVI.2011 released H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during lignin breakdown. There is another route called Aryl alcohol oxidases (AAOs) which has been studied in some white rot fungi for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. In some species of <italic>Bjerkandera</italic>, chlorinated anisyl alcohols are reduced by AAO to produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (De Jong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1994</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We aimed to illustrate for the first time the decay mechanism of lignin by the ligninolytic enzymes secreted by MVI.2011, a &#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; fungus. Though the available literature abounds in data on lignin-degrading enzymes from different fungi, the &#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; fungus MVI.2011 has been found to secrete enzymes which serve to completely decompose and mineralise lignin over a wide range of pH and temperature, conditions under which generally fungi and other available biological alternatives fail to perform efficiently. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to try to explore such biological entities further for various biotechnological applications including degradation of dyes or dye-based effluent, tannery waste, aromatic hydrocarbons which form important part of lignin structure and pre-treatment of recalcitrant natural lignocelluloses biomass for use as biofuels (Joshi and Gold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1993</xref>; Wolter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1997</xref>; Hofrichter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>; McMullan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>; Stolz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2001</xref>). It can be concluded from the spectroscopic data (FTIR and GC&#x02013;MS) that lignin both purified and natural when acted upon by the fungus MVI.2011 was broken down by enzymes LiP, MnP and Laccase along with several others to a considerable extent including opening up of aromatic rings and c&#x02013;c bonds, formation of organic acids, higher alkanes, etc. So the direct evidence for structure alterations of lignin during MVI.2011 degradation from the present study provides a useful idea about the industrial and commercial application of the organism especially in pulp and paper industry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec36"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
