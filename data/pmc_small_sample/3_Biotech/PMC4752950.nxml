with wide range of applications in animal and human nutrition. These catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoester bonds in phytate, thereby releasing lower forms of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol phosphates and inorganic phosphate. Addition of phytase to plant-based foods can improve its nutritional value and increase mineral bioavailability by decreasing nutritional effect of phytate. In the present investigation, 43 phytase positive bacteria on PSM plates were isolated from different sources and characterized for phytase activity. On the basis of phytase activity and zone of hydrolysis, two bacterial isolates (PSB-15 and PSB-45) were selected for further characterization studies, i.e., pH and temperature optima and stability, kinetic properties and effect of modulators. The phytases from both isolates were optimally active at the pH value from 3 to 8 and in the temperature range of 50&#x02013;70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Further, the stability of isolates was good in the pH range of 3.0&#x02013;8.0. Much variation was observed in temperature and storage stability, responses of phytases to metal ions and modulators. The <italic>K</italic>

<sub>max</sub> values for PSB-15 phytase were 0.48&#x000a0;mM and 0.157&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M/min, while for PSB-45 these were 1.25&#x000a0;mM and 0.140&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M/min, respectively. Based on 16S rDNA gene sequence, the isolates were identified as <italic>Serratia</italic> sp. PSB-15 (GenBank Accession No. KR133277) and <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> strain PSB-45 (GenBank Accession No. KR133282). The novel phytases from these isolates have multiple characteristics of high thermostability and good phytase activity at desirable range of pH and temperature for their efficient use in food and feed to facilitate hydrolysis of phytate-metal ion complex and in turn, increased bioavailability of important metal ions to monogastric animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Phytase</kwd><kwd>Phytate</kwd><kwd>Micronutrient bioavailability</kwd><kwd>Phosphorus</kwd><kwd>Monogastric animals</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most of the cereals and legumes are rich in carbohydrates and proteins but some of them have certain antinutritional factors which restrict their use in food. One such antinutritional factor is the phytic acid (<italic>myo</italic>-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexa<italic>kis</italic>phosphate; IP<sub>6</sub>) which is the major storage form of phosphorus (60&#x02013;80&#x000a0;%), in soil (Turner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2002</xref>), grains (Lott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>) and manures from monogastric animals (Barnett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1994</xref>). It acts as an antinutrient as it chelates various micronutrients such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> and diminishes their bioavailability in digestive tract of monogastric animals due to lack of enzyme for hydrolysis of phytate complexes (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>). Therefore, consumption of food containing large amount of phytate may cause severe mineral deficiency. The micronutrient deficiency could be alleviated using exogenous phytase addition (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>), development of phytase secreting transgenic plants (Brinch-Pedersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2000</xref>), and production of low phytate mutant plants to use in food and feed of the humans (Raboy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2001</xref>). Addition of phytase during food processing is most preferred as the other two approaches may lead to decreased seed phytate leading to deleterious effect on germination and decreased agricultural field. Phytases (<italic>myo</italic>-inositol hexaphophohydrolase; EC. 3.1.3.) are the class of phosphatases which are capable of hydrolysing phytic acid with the release of inorganic phosphorus and divalent cations. So far, many phytases from microbes have been demonstrated to be useful as feed additive in monogastric animals and various phytase preparations are commercially available. None of the commercial phytases investigated, satisfied all of the criteria of an ideal phytase for use in animal feed (Boyce and Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>). Therefore, most of the research on phytases has been focused on isolation and characterization of novel phytases from different sources (Choi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2001</xref>; Greiner and Farouk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>; Lei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>). The present study, therefore, was carried out to isolate and screen rhizospheric soil bacterial isolates for extracellular phytase production with suitable biochemical properties and use in food and feed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>All the chemicals and reagents used in this study were of molecular biology and analytical grade and procured from standard manufacturers as GeNei, Sigma, Merck and HiMedia Pvt.

</p><p>To make further selection and find out best phytase producing PSB isolates after selection of PSB isolates on the basis of formation of halo zone on calcium phytate plates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), these were assayed for phytase activity (U/ml) in liquid PSM media under standard conditions at different time intervals, i.e., 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;h. Results presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> revealed different isolates had varying phytase activity under given conditions at different time periods. Some PSB isolates had maximum phytase activity at 24&#x000a0;h, but most of the cultures possessed significantly good range of activity at 48&#x000a0;h and subsequent decrease on 72&#x000a0;h of incubation, except a few. Different trends were obtained with phytase activity vs time of incubation and depending on isolate and its source of isolation. The enzyme activity varied from 0.006 to 0.305&#x000a0;U/ml depending on the above factors. It was interesting to notice that more than 60&#x000a0;%, i.e., 16 out of 26 isolates from soils (10 out of 16 from rhizospheric soils) and 6 out of 9 isolates from compost sample produced maximum phytase activity after 72&#x000a0;h of incubation. On the other hand, more than 85&#x000a0;% of isolates (6 of 7 isolates) from wood samples produced maximum phytase activity before 72&#x000a0;h (at 24 and 48&#x000a0;h) of incubation under given conditions of growth. Different PSB phytases showed different enzyme activity in PSM. Maximum phytase activity at 48&#x000a0;h was shown by PSB-45 (0.305&#x000a0;U/ml) followed by PSB-15, PSB-33, PSB-38 and PSB-31 (0.285, 0.285, 0.273 and 0.258&#x000a0;U/ml, respectively) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Comparative phytase activity of selected PSB isolates at different time</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_378_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

To determine the phytate solubilization index, the isolates were further grown on PSM plates supplemented calcium phytate by point inoculation. The isolates were found to produce clearance zone of varying diameter on phytase screening medium containing calcium phytate as substrate. Among these, PSB-15 showed maximum diameter of zone of 3.4.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p>Phytase is an enzyme chemically known as myo-inositol hexakisphosphate phosphohydrolase. It hydrolyzes phytic acid to myo-inositol and phosphoric acid in a stepwise manner forming myo-inositol phosphate intermediates. The addition of microbial phytase has been seen as a way to reduce the level of phosphate pollution in areas of intensive animal production. Numerous studies have shown the effectiveness of supplementation of microbial phytases in improving utilization of phosphate from phytate. Therefore, inorganic phosphorous supplementation in the diets of monogastric animals can be obviated by including adequate amounts of phytase and as a result, the faecal phosphate excretion of these animals may be reduced by up to 50&#x000a0;% (Walz and Pallauf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002</xref>). Moreover, phytate acts as anti-nutrient by binding to protein and chelating minerals. Addition of phytase can improve the nutritional value of plant based foods by enhancing protein digestibility and mineral availability through phytate hydrolysis. Since certain myo-inositol phosphates have been proposed to have novel metabolic effects, phytase may be used to produce functional food. Although phytase can be commercially produced from four commercial phytase preparations viz. NatuphosTM (BASF, <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> phytase), RonozymeTM (DSM, <italic>Peniophora lycii</italic> phytase), PhyzymeTM (Diversa/Danisco A/S, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> phytase, and QuantumTM (Diversa/Syngenta, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> phytase), none of the commercial phytases assessed satisfied all of the criteria of an ideal phytase for use in animal feed. Because phytases with the required properties for animal feed application have not been found in nature so far, studies are ongoing to identify phytases which are more suited to animal feed applications than current commercial preparations.</p><p>Though the enzyme is widely distributed in nature, microorganisms are considered potentially most suitable for industrial exploitation due to ease of cultivation and manipulation of cultural conditions in the minimum space and time. Microbial phytases are actively secreted into soil, where they participated both in decomposition of fresh plant debris and in the liberation of phosphorus from soil organic compounds. Thus, microbial phytases are the key enzymes of the P cycling in the soil (Jorquera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). The importance of soil microorganisms for increasing the availability of phosphorus from phytates to plant roots has been suggested by Tarafdar and Marschner (Tarafdar and Marschner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1995</xref>). Similarly, (Richardson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2000</xref>) had also highlighted the potential role of soil microorganisms for increasing the availability of phosphorus from phytates through phytase action. In earlier studies, known phytate-degrading organisms that include aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria and fungi were isolated from different environmental conditions but bacteria as a source of the enzymes are cheaper and take less time for enzyme production than other sources. Survey of microorganisms for selection of potential phytase producers was the subject of study by several workers (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>; Yanke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1999</xref>; Yoon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1996</xref>). Different workers used multiple sources for isolation of phytase positive isolates including different kinds of soils, animals and plants. Wood (rotten) as a source for phytase producing microbes (<italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>) was used by Vats and Banerjee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2002</xref>).</p><p>In the present study also, although different sources were used for isolation of PSB isolates, degraded wood as source of novel phytase positive isolates also emerged as potential source of these microbes. Degraded wood was reported as a source of tannin degrading <italic>Serratia</italic> sp. by Pepi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). Ability of bacterial isolates from varying habitats to produce extracellular phytase reveals their high diversity and further strengthens chances of getting potential isolates for a suitable phytase with desired properties.

PSB-15 with good phytate solubilization index, extracellular phytase production, thermostability and varying activity parameters was found to be interesting and could be utilized for further application purposes.</p><p>The use of calcium phytate as the sole phosphorus and carbon source and formation of halo zone on PSM plates and phytase activity in media was effectively used for selection of phytase secreting/phytate solubilizing bacteria, which has been adopted in several previous studies on <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> (Kerovuo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>), <italic>Bacillus sp.</italic> DS11 (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>) and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains (Shimizu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1992</xref>), where each produced a positive response to the plate clearing as well as an enzyme activity assay. It is proved to be a useful and effective strategy for such studies on screening and isolation of phytase positive isolates as growth on plates is usually easier than in a liquid medium for phytate-degrading bacteria (Choi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2001</xref>; Richardson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>), hence no further assessment need to be conducted on isolates that could not grow or form halo zone on PSM plates. Further, no direct correlation was found between halo zone on PSM plates to the phytase activity in liquid media which might be due to different specificity of PSB phytases for sodium phytate and calcium phytate as in liquid media sodium phytate was used compared to calcium phytate in PSM plates. Some strains produced clearance zone but the diameter of the clearance zone and growth of the organism were comparatively very slow, which could be a reflection of the isolates inability to degrade phytate or perhaps, merely an indication of unfavourable conditions for phytase production.</p><p>Decreasing pH during phytase production in liquid culture is a common feature of phosphate solubilizing bacterial isolates as major microbiological means by which insoluble phosphate compounds are mobilized is the production of organic acids, accompanied by acidification of the medium. The organic and inorganic acids convert tricalcium phosphate in soil to di- and mono-basic phosphates with the net result of and enhanced availability of the element to the plants (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2005</xref>). Decreased media pH during this study revealed their possible application as phosphate solubilizer and liquid bio-fertilizer for increasing plant growth and productivity. Characterization of these PSB isolates for their ability to solubilize different kinds of phosphate compounds will be the very important aspect of further studies on these isolates.</p><p>The ability of a phytase to hydrolyze phytate in the digestive tract is determined by its enzymatic properties. As stomach is the main functional site of supplemental phytase, an enzyme with an acidic pH optimum is certainly desirable. The main area of concern for the phytase is the low activity and stability under different conditions of pH. Although, the optimum pH of enzyme activity from both isolates was in the common range of pH 4.5&#x02013;7.5 for maximum activity of general bacterial phytases viz. <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> MOK1 and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. (pH 5.5), <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. 4 (pH 5.5), <italic>Obesumbacterium proteus</italic> (pH 4.9), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (pH 4.5), <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. DS11 (pH 7.0), <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. (pH 6.0) and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (natto) N-77 (6.0-6-5) (Golovan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1999</xref>; Kerovuo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>; Popanich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2003</xref>; Shimizu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1992</xref>; Yoon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1996</xref>; Zinin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2004</xref>), but results revealed these bacterial phytases as desirable with good activity and stability at pH in the range of 3.0&#x02013;8.0. Activity and stability (with &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;% residual activity) of selected <italic>Serratia</italic> and <italic>Enterobacter</italic> strains was in this range of pH. According to (Mukhametzyanova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>), bacterial phytases of <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Enterobacter</italic> species generally have pH optimum in the range from 6.0 to 8.0, but phytase from this study was even stable at lower pH and shown to be higher stable at such pH values and their usability under condition of low pH in stomach. From a physiologically relevant standpoint, these phytases displayed significant activity and stability between pH 3.0 and 6.0, a range necessary to facilitate phytate degradation in mouth (pH 5.0&#x02013;7.0), stomach (fed state pH 6.5, reducing to 3.5&#x02013;4.5 upon stimulation of acid secretion) and upper part of the duodenum (pH 4.0&#x02013;6.0). The loss of activity under high alkaline and acidic conditions might be due to the protein structure of phytase changed under the strong alkali or acid conditions to make phytase lose its activity (Jorquera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). The PSB phytases, those showed very good activity at acidic and alkaline pH could be used as feed additive. Both selected PSB phytases show good activity at acidic and alkaline pH.</p><p>As per expectations of getting an extremophile organism and thermostable phytase from compost, we have obtained <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> strain PSB-45 phytase with novel properties including high optimum temperature for maximum phytase activity which were differ from other <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. phytase as reported by Yoon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1996</xref>). Although the enzyme from PSB-45 isolate had high temperature optima but it was not having desired thermostability at higher temperature. The temperature optimum for <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> strain PSB-45 phytase was higher than PSB-15 phytase. Similar temperature optima for maximum phytase activity was reported in <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. DS11 and <italic>Klebseilla aerobgenes</italic> (Jareonkitmongkol et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1997</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). Temperature optima for phytase from isolate PSB-15 was higher than that of optimum temperatures reported by other workers, i.e., 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for that from <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. KHU-10 (Choi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2001</xref>), 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for that from <italic>Obesumbacterium proteus</italic> (Zinin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2004</xref>), 58&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for that from <italic>A. Niger</italic> 11T53A9 (Greiner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>) and comparable to <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (natto) N-77 (Shimizu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1992</xref>).</p><p>Thermal stability of phytase and the ability to refold to an active conformation are important properties from a commercial perspective. Enzyme thermal stability is pertinent in animal feed applications (Pandey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>), where the enzyme preparations are normally incorporated into the meals before pelleting. The pelleting of feed helps animals to have a balanced diet and facilitates preservation from feed borne pathogens. However, during the pelleting process the enzyme is exposed to temperatures around 65&#x02013;95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with holding times from 1 to 10&#x000a0;min (Bohn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007</xref>). Therefore, all feed enzymes need to be heat stable to avoid substantial activity loss during this process. Although phytase inclusion using an after-spray apparatus for pelleted diets and/or chemical coating of phytase may help bypass or overcome the heat destruction of the enzyme, phytases resisting high temperatures will no doubt be better candidates for feed supplements. As revealed from results some of the isolates were reported more than 80&#x000a0;% residual phytase activity after such treatment. In this regard, <italic>Serratia</italic> sp. PSB-15 was observed to be best among studied phytase in this study. It exhibited very good tolerance and retained 81&#x000a0;% of its original activity at 80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min and consistently, retained ~70&#x000a0;% activity up to 20&#x000a0;min at 80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. It was even more thermostable than commercially available phytases from <italic>A. niger</italic> (retained 50&#x000a0;% of the initial activity for 10&#x000a0;min at 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and <italic>P. lycii</italic> (completely inactivated after 15&#x000a0;min at 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) (Greiner and Farouk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Garrett et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>) also investigated the thermostability of phytase from <italic>E. coli</italic> and they found that it did not lose any activity after heating for 1&#x000a0;h at 62&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and retained only 27&#x000a0;% residual activity when heated at 85&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min. At temperatures between 50 and 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, it underwent an irreversible conformational change that resulted in 70&#x02013;80&#x000a0;% loss of enzyme activity. From comparison with above studies, it could be said that phytase enzyme from our source isolates (<italic>Serratia</italic> sp. PSB-15 and <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> strain PSB-45) are suitable for pelleting and their displayed higher thermal stability would be an added advantage for potential commercial interest.</p><p>Residual activity of the crude enzyme from both isolates at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was determined after 30&#x000a0;days. Investigation of the storage stability of PSB phytase after 30&#x000a0;days showed different values. From this study it was found that only isolates PB-15 retained more than 95&#x000a0;% activity. Storage stability data clearly revealed that enzyme from these isolates could not be stored for longer or if needed, alternate strategies must be adopted for long time storage of PSB phytases. When the enzyme was kept at room temperature, phytase activity decreased as compared to when enzyme was stored in refrigerator after 30&#x000a0;days.</p><p>There are various reports in which metal ions have been shown to modulate phytate-degrading activity. Phytases from different microbes differed in their requirement for metal ions for their activity. The inhibitory effect of metal ions on phytase activity might be ascribed to the strong chelating ability of phytate, where binding of metal ions on phytate might impair access of the enzyme to the functional group on the phytate molecule leading to decreased activity (Maenz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1999</xref>). These results are in conformity with (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>), who reported that phytase of <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. DS11 was strongly inhibited by Mn<sup>2+</sup> and moderately inhibited by Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> at 5&#x000a0;mM concentration. Yanke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1999</xref>) also reported that the mixtures containing 5&#x000a0;mM Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Hg<sup>2+</sup>, strongly inhibited phytase activity of <italic>Selenomonas ruminantium</italic>. The partially purified enzyme from <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> MO-3 was strongly inhibited by Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cr<sup>2+</sup> inhibited enzyme activity of r-PhyB49, a BPPhy from <italic>Serratia</italic> sp. (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2011</xref>). Hong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>) also observed decrease in enzyme activity of <italic>Bacillus</italic> phytase in presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Cr<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup>. Phytase from <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. 4 was inhibited by each addition of 1&#x000a0;mM Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup> and EDTA (Yoon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1996</xref>).</p><p>The observations from effect of modulators inferred that mercaptoethanol was least effective in reducing the activity of PSB phytases except PSB-25 which was least stable. As reducing reagents 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiotreitol (DTT) have no major effects on PSB phytases suggesting that these enzymes either have no free and accessible sulfhydryl groups play a negligible role in the enzyme activity and structure. In case of urea, it inhibits both PSB phytases activity &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;% suggesting that as concentration of urea increases, the kinetics of inactivation and the denaturation by urea increases linearly (Xiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2004</xref>). In case of ascorbic acid, selected PSB-15 phytases was found to be unstable with ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid forms protonated chelates by coordinating with metal ions at low intermediate pH, while unprotonated chelates at higher pH (Martell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1982</xref>). Presence of EDTA inhibited PSB-15 phytase activity to large extent (35&#x000a0;% relative activity). Inactivation of phytase by EDTA was also reported in phytase from <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. (Rao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>) and <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>). Thus, decreased PSB phytases activity with EDTA might be due to interference in availability of metal ions required for activity. Similar to phytase from <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. 4, phytase from <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> strain PSB-45 was inhibited by EDTA (Yoon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1996</xref>).</p><p>Kinetic parameters (<italic>K</italic>

<sub>m</sub> of <italic>E. cloacae</italic> strain PSB-45 phytase was comparable to <italic>Kodamaea ohmeri</italic> BG3 phytase (1.28&#x000a0;mM) (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>). The isolates differed in their morphological, growth and biochemical characteristics and these characteristics may be useful while utilizing these isolates for optimization and large scale production of phytase enzyme.</p><p>Literature survey suggested that the phytase dose of 250&#x02013;1500&#x000a0;U/kg feed was considered suitable for proper hydrolysis of phytate complexes in feed and it dependent on several factors such as animal type, phytase sources, diet formulation (amount of substrate for phytase) and selected response parameters (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>). Thus, the increased phosphorus up to 45&#x000a0;% over control with the use of 250 phytase U/Kg meal in present study further support the potential applicability of both the phytases in food and feed. A similar increase in phosphorus content was also reported by application of a recombinant phytase by Kumar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>). It could have a significant impact on the enhanced bioavailability of phosphorus and other phosphorus bound micronutrients into food and feed under consideration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study resulted into characterization of multiple bacterial isolates up to their kinetic properties with some key findings discussed above.
