About one-third of the world&#x02019;s food crop is destroyed by pests annually (Punitha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>). Different groups of pesticides with various formulations have been introduced into agricultural soils either simultaneously or in succession to protect crops from weeds, insects, and fungi. Pesticides have beneficial impacts in improving and stabilizing agricultural productivity by controlling pests; however, these organic chemicals may contaminate the soil ecosystem and various groups of organisms in soil, which play a vital role in mineralization, nitrification and phosphorus recycling. Among the different groups of organisms, microorganisms play an important role in many soil biological processes; soil enzymes play various biochemical functions in the overall process of organic matter decomposition in the soil system (Burns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1983</xref>; Sinsabaugh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1991</xref>). The soil activities undergo complex biochemical processes that consist of integrated and ecologically connected synthetic processes, immobilization and enzyme stability (Khaziyev and Gulke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1991</xref>). Many investigations were performed to study the effect of various pesticides on different enzyme activities in soils of different origin (Sannino and Gianfreda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2001</xref>). The application of various pesticides may adversely affect not only the soil microflora but also soil enzymes and physico-chemical properties such as pH, salinity and alkalinity that cause damage to the fertility of the soil. The enzymatic activities in soil are mainly from microbial origin, and are derived from intracellular, cell associated or free enzymes (Mohiuddin and Mohammed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>). Therefore, it is clear that there is a close relationship between pesticides and microorganisms, because these chemicals may have a deleterious effect on non-target microorganisms and most of these pesticides could be metabolized by different microorganisms resulting in the modification of their activity (Walia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>).</p><p>India, Anantapuramu, a semiarid region of Andhra Pradesh, ranks first in the area of groundnut (<italic>Arachis hypogaea</italic> L.) cultivation, but its productivity is low and fluctuates around 9&#x000a0;q&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on average (Anonymous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>). Groundnut is one of the important major profitable oil seed crop grown throughout the year in India (Guha and Chandrasekhar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>) and contributes to 41.3&#x000a0;% of the country&#x02019;s oilseed production (Giraddi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>). The monocropping of groundnut with high-yielding varieties resulted in an eruption of fungi, causing damage to groundnut crop in many areas of Andhra Pradesh; more than 90 insect pests and mites were found to be associated with the groundnut crop (Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1995</xref>). To protest the groundnut crop loss and to get higher yield, the chemical use of pesticides has become an essential part in modern agriculture (Parama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1997</xref>). Reports were available on the influence of pesticides on microbial activity with a different methodological approach (Gianfreda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1995</xref>; Sannino and Gianfreda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2001</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, the influence of two fungicides, tebuconazole and copper hydroxide, on the activities of phosphatase and urease enzymes of selected soil samples were investigated. These two enzymes have been selected because they play an important role in the carbon&#x02013;nitrogen and phosphorus&#x02013;sulfur cycles in soils. Phosphatase, which is an exracellular enzyme produced by many soil microorganisms, is responsible for the hydrolysis of organic phosphorus compounds to inorganic phosphorus (Monkiedje and Spiteller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>). Phosphatase carries out a broad range of intracellular as well as soil-accumulated activities that catalyze the hydrolysis of both the esters and anhydrides of phosphoric acid. Urease in general helps to maintain nitrogen in the form of ammonia (NH<sub>4</sub>
<sup>+</sup>) and is less leachable (Srinivasulu and Rangaswamy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>). Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>
<sup>+</sup> ions by acting on C&#x02013;N non-peptide bonds in linear amides (Ramudu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). Urease in particular is a useful indicator to evaluate soil pollution. The application of pesticides to soil decreases the urease activity that reduces the hydrolysis of urea which is beneficial to soil fertility (Anuradha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>).</p><p>Many synthetic fungicides were developed in the 1940&#x02013;1950s based on &#x02018;old fungicide chemistry&#x02019; (Wightwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>). These fungicides have a broad-spectrum multisite mode of action and are applied at high concentration rates. Many other fungicides were developed since 1970 based on &#x02018;modern fungicide chemistry&#x02019;, which have specific modes of action, and greater activity was applied at relatively lower application rates (Russell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2005</xref>). Few laboratory studies have been reported on the impact of fungicides on soil enzyme activity with contradictory effects. In the present study, a triazole fungicide tebuconazole and copper-based fungicide copper hydroxide were used based on their efficacy on soil enzymes. Tebuconazole, which is a systemic fungicide with protective action, is used as a spray that controls the leaf spot of groundnut. It is a potent xenobiotic to which exposure can cause metabolic alterations and lead to death of different organisms (Sehnem et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>). The IUPAC name of tebuconazole is [(RS)-1-<italic>p</italic>-chlorophenyl-4,-dimethyl-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl) pentan-3-ol] (Potter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). Copper-based fungicides that cause reduction in the populations of fungi and actinomycetes and inhibit nitrification, as well as to stimulate bacterial populations have been reported (Hussain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Lo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). In addition, copper hydroxide was selected as it represents a traditional Cu-based fungicide that has been in use for over 50&#x000a0;years in many parts of the world.</p><p>With this view, a laboratory study was conducted on the effect of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide on phosphatase and urease enzyme activities in selected soil samples. A little information is available on the behavior of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide on soil enzyme activities. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the response of the selected fungicides on phosphatase and urease enzyme activities. Hence in the present laboratory experiment, attempts were made to update the effect of selected fungicides on phosphatase and urease enzyme activities in groundnut soils, the major crop grown in Anantapuramu District, Andhra Pradesh, India.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Soils used in the present study</title><p>Two soil samples, a black clay soil and red sandy loam soil, were collected from groundnut-cultivated fields of Anantapuramu District, Andhra Pradesh, India.

Water-holding capacity (WHC) of the soil samples was determined by adding distilled water up to the saturation point and then 60&#x000a0;% water-holding capacity of the soil samples was calculated by Johnson and Ulrich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1960</xref>). The pH of the soil samples was determined by mixing soil and water in the ratio of 1:1.25 using Systonics digital pH meter with calomel glass electrode assembly. Organic carbon content in soil samples was estimated by Walkey&#x02013;Black method and the organic matter was calculated by multiplying the values with 1.72 (Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1971</xref>). The electrical conductivity of soil samples after addition of 100&#x000a0;ml distilled water to 1&#x000a0;g soil samples was measured by a conductivity bridge. The total nitrogen content in soil samples was determined by the method reported by Jackson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1971</xref>). The inorganic ammonium-nitrogen content in soil samples after extraction of 1&#x000a0;M KCl by the Nesslerization method Jackson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1971</xref>) and the contents of nitrite-nitrogen were determined by the method reported by Barnes and Folkard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1951</xref>), and the contents of nitrate-nitrogen by Brucine method Ranney and Bartlett (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1972</xref>) after extraction with distilled water were determined.

In comparison, tebuconazole at 5.0&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> produced maximum stimulation in phosphatase activity in black clay soil than red sandy loam soil. At higher concentrations, i.e., 7.5 and 10.0&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, phosphatase activity was significantly inhibited by treating the selected soil samples with both the selected fungicides. Among the two fungicide treatments, tebuconazole produced a different stimulation over the control. In the present study, comparatively, black soil showed higher enzyme activity than red soil throughout the experiment. Phosphatase activity was significantly inhibited at higher concentrations, i.e., 7.5 and 10.0&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in both the fungicide treatments, gradually with the incubation periods, i.e., 20, 30 and 40&#x000a0;days (Rangaswamy and Venkateswarlu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1996</xref>). Therefore in the present experiment, the maximum inhibition was recorded after 30 and 40&#x000a0;days of incubation periods. The enhancement in phosphatase activity over control was noticed in the black soil after 20&#x000a0;days of incubation. In the case of red sandy loam soil, the enhancement by the selected fungicides was also obtained at 5.0&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 20&#x000a0;days of incubation and recorded in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

</p><p>Gianfreda et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1995</xref>) and Tabatabai and Bremner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1969</xref>) described the enzymatic systems which stimulate free enzymes in the soil solution and enzyme&#x02013;soil colloid associations were considered. The effects of some selected pesticides on the activity of these enzymatic systems were studied. The results clearly indicate that the initial days of application of fungicides drastically reduced the number of bacteria and beneficial microflora, i.e., phosphate solubilizing bacteria in fungicide-amended soils when compared with the control soil. Unlike the previous study, there was some reported inhibition of phosphatase activity by captan (Chen and Edwards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2001</xref>; Piotrowska-Seget et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2008</xref>). Walia et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>) reported the results on phosphatase activity with mancozeb, indicating the maximum average phosphatase activity at zero ppm (121.8&#x000a0;U) and the average activity decreased significantly to 113.2&#x000a0;U at 100&#x000a0;ppm mancozeb concentration. As the incubation period increases, there was decreased average phosphatase activity with no significant difference between various tebuconazole and copper hydroxide concentrations used in the present study. The decrease in the enzyme activity may be due to the decrease in the microbial population, destruction or inactivation of preexisting soil enzymes and the substrate limiting for enzyme induction. From the present study, the process of phosphorus solubilization was not distributed by the selected fungicide treatment. Ahemad and Khan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>) showed that P-solubilization was in a minor way affected at recommended doses, but majorly affected at higher doses of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide. This may be because the soil microbial population can solubilize the added insoluble phosphates and is enriched in the presence of higher concentrations of the selected fungicides. In addition to that, the total population of microorganisms was decreased and resulted in the lesser utilization of the released phosphorus. For instance, tebuconazole is a potent xenobiotic, the exposure to which can cause metabolic alterations and the death of different microorganisms (Sehnem et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40"> 2010</xref>). Wightwick et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>) reported that the interactive effects of Cu on the toxicity of captan and trifloxystrobin to soil microbial functions are not known and the toxicity of the alternative synthetic organic fungicide compounds may be increased if they are additive effects with Cu. Exposure to prolonged Cu may result in the alteration of the susceptibility of soil microbial population to the additional stress caused by application of these synthetic fungicide compounds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Urease activity</title><p>The results obtained from the present study stated that there was about 57&#x02013;253 and 61&#x02013;207&#x000a0;% increase in the urease activity in black soil observed over the control. This was noticed in the black soil after 10&#x000a0;days of incubation period, whereas in the case of red sandy loam soil, the corresponding figures of the percentage enhancement by the two selected fungicides, tebuconazole and copper hydroxide, at two levels were 63&#x02013;203 and 43&#x02013;156&#x000a0;% during the same period of incubation. However on comparison of tebuconazole and copper hydroxide at 5.0&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, tebuconazole produced maximum stimulation in urease activity in black clay soil than red sandy loam soil in the present study. At higher concentrations, i.e., 7.5 and 10.0&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, urease activity was significantly inhibited by treating the selected soil samples with both the selected fungicides. Among the two fungicide treatments, tebuconazole produced a different stimulation over control. In the present study, comparatively, the black soil showed higher enzyme activity than the red soil throughout the experiment. It can be concluded that the high enzymatic activities are associated with high organic matter content. Urease activity was significantly inhibited gradually at higher concentrations, i.e., 7.5 and 10.0&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, in both the fungicide treatments with the incubation periods, i.e., 20, 30 and 40&#x000a0;days (Rangaswamy and Venkateswarlu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1996</xref>). In the present experiment, the maximum inhibition was recorded after 30 and 40&#x000a0;days of incubation periods. The inhibitory effect was reduced upon further incubation due to the reduction in the concentration and degradation of the applied fungicides. Ramudu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>) stated that the activity of urease, implicated in the hydrolysis of urea, was significantly enhanced under the impact of propiconazole and chlorothalonil up to 5.0&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> level in both the soils. The two fungicides at 10, 25, 50&#x000a0;ppm levels individually cause 7&#x02013;35 and 13&#x02013;53&#x000a0;% increase in urease activity, respectively, compared to control in laterite soil and 28&#x02013;54 and 12&#x02013;52&#x000a0;%, respectively, compared to control in vertisol soil in a 10-day interval. For instance, Bending et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>) reported that applications of azoxystrobin, tebuconazole and chlorothalonil affected the size and structure of microorganisms in the soils with low organic matter, but not in a comparable soil with high organic matter. The urease enzyme plays an important role in nitrogen cycling. Decrease in the enzyme activity results in the change in ion concentration, pH, and reduction of oxidation potential on solid organic and inorganic particles interspersed with mineral particles of larger size and inhibition of active site of urease enzyme by the selected fungicides. There have been reports on the effect of captan and trifloxystrobin on urease activity. The results obtained from the previous study suggest that the copper hydroxide alternatives, captan and trifloxystrobin, do not pose a short-term risk and are relatively more toxic than copper hydroxide to N cycling processes in soil. Similarly, urease activity was inhibited by napropamide at all concentrations relative to the control with long periods of pesticide application (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>). In the same way, Cycon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>) noticed that urease activity declined in red sandy loamy soils with a combination (mancozeb&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;dimethomorph) at higher concentrations than control. Comparatively in the present study, the black soil showed higher urease activity than the red soil throughout the experiment due to its high organic matter content. Several studies reported that the stimulation of soil enzyme activities was associated with high organic matter content (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>
