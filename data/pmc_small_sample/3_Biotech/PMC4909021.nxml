During the study, the effect of various reactor parameters such as hydraulic retention time (HRT), biogenetic substrate concentration, loading rate, and initial substrate concentration on the removal efficiency of 4-CP was investigated. Bioreactor showed a maximum removal rate of 16.59&#x000a0;mg/L/h at the optimum conditions of 24&#x000a0;h HRT, 400&#x000a0;mg/L initial 4-CP, and 0.2&#x000a0;g/L peptone. The optimum HRT found was 24&#x000a0;h after that the washout occured, and the degradation efficiency almost dropped to 50&#x000a0;% at 18&#x000a0;h HRT. Effect of peptone showed that lower concentration of peptone improves 4-CP removal efficiency of the bioreactor. Also, the mixed consortium had utilized 4-CP as a carbon source, as evidenced by the increasing biomass concentration with 4-CP at constant peptone concentration. The presence of 5-chloro 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde in the reactor infers that the mixed consortium has followed the meta-cleavage pathway for 4-CP degradation.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>4-chlorophenol</kwd><kwd>Airlift reactor</kwd><kwd>Biodegradation</kwd><kwd>Wastewater</kwd><kwd>Biogenic substrate</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With heavy industrialization and urbanization, activities polluting the environment and concomitantly sabotaging the inherent ecosystems have enormously increased. Chlorophenols have been classified as priority pollutants by the US Environmental Protection Agency (ATSDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). They are primarily found in the industrial effluent from pulp and paper, leather tanning, biocide, dyes, herbicide and chlorination of drinking and waste water (Olaniran and Igbinosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>; Field and Sierra-Alvarez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>). Chlorophenols are persistent and bio-accumulative in nature due to its physicochemical properties that cause detrimental effects on the environment. Chlorophenol compounds have been demonstrated to have mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, and may cause fatalities (IARC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1986</xref>; Daniel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2001</xref>). Conventional methods such as adsorption, chemical oxidation, photo-degradation and solvent extraction have limitations due to their high cost of implementation, production of toxic by-products and low energy efficiency (Herrera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; Durruty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>). These treatments transform the toxic compounds from one phase to another. On contrary, biological treatment is a potential substitute with promising removal efficiency and complete mineralization of the chlorophenols. It is eco-friendly and energy efficient treatment with assuring future (Field and Sierra-Alvarez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>; Olaniran and Igbinosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>; Basak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>; Chakraborty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>).</p><p>There are several reports on various microorganisms that have been identified for utilizing chlorophenols as a carbon and energy source such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Comamonas testosteroni, Ralstonia eutropha, Bacillus subtilis, Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus, Burkholderia</italic> sp., and <italic>Kocuria rhizophila</italic>. (El-Sayed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>; Arora and Bae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>; Field and Sierra-Alvarez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>; Hollender et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>; Monsalvo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2012</xref>; Patel and Kumar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>). Biodegradation of chlorophenols in different bioreactor system under aerobic and anaerobic conditions has been reported. Attention has been given to study and modify the different bioreactors such as packed bedreactor, fluidized bed reactor, upflow anaerobic sludge blanket, combined anaerobic and aerobic treatment and membrane reactor to enhance the performance of wastewater treatment containing lower to higher chlorophenols (Quan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>; Gal&#x000ed;ndez-Mayer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>; Gomez-De Jesus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Visvanathan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>; Atuanya and Chakrabarti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>). Aerobic biodegradation is usually preferred for lower chlorophenols such as mono and di-chlorophenol and sometimes tri-chlorophenols. While, for the treatment of higher chlorophenols such as tri, tetra, and pentachlorophenol, an anaerobic biodegradation is more effective (Poggi-Varaldo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>).</p><p>Wastewater treatment plant commonly contains the mixture of different recalcitrant synthetic organic compounds (SOC) along with biogenic substrates. The common treatment plants are not able to treat recalcitrant SOC effectively and generally passes through without complete treatment (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>). The treatment of recalcitrant compounds can be improved by process optimization. These require the understanding of biomass acclimation, interaction between biogenic substrate and recalcitrant compounds, and reactor operating conditions for SOC treatment. Different factors such as hydraulic retention time, loading rate and the presence of other secondary carbon and nitrogen source have to be considered and optimized for better performance and efficiency of the bioreactors.</p><p>Airlift reactors (ALR) are simple in design with no moving parts or agitator, thus economical. In ALR, pressurized gas is used for internal mixing and aeration. It has low shear stress on microbial cells which will be an advantage for shear sensitive cells. In packed bed reactor where mass and oxygen transfer limitation and clogging of packing bed occur, these problems can be avoided in ALR (Zilouei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2006</xref>; Quan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>). There are several reports on biodegradation of chlorophenols and other toxic compounds using ALR. Quan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>) reported the removal of phenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol in the airlift honeycomb-like ceramic reactor (Quan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>). They have used ceramic honeycomb-like structure placed inside the riser for immobilization of pure culture <italic>Achromobacter</italic> sp. A packed bed bioreactor equipped with the net draft tube riser (PB-ALR) for liquid circulation and oxygenation was constructed for the removal of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (Gomez-De Jesus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>). In the present study, simple airlift bioreactor without any immobilization of microorganism was used for removal of 4-chlorophenol. The absence of agitator for mixing and any carrier for immobilization of microorganism makes the bioreactor simple with ease in operation and economical.</p><p>The present study focussed on the continuous biodegradation of 4-chlorophenol in an airlift inner loop bioreactor using the mixed microbial consortium. During the continuous operation, the effect of different parameters such as hydraulic retention time, loading rate, biogenic substrate concentration and initial substrate concentration on removal efficiency of ALR was studied. The different metabolites present in the effluent were detected to analyze the biodegradation pathway followed by the mixed consortium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Loba chemie, India supplied analytical grade 4-CP (purity 98&#x000a0;%).

</p><p>The present investigation focussed on continuous removal of 4-CP, divided into three parts. First, the effect of peptone concentration on removal efficiency of 4-CP was studied. Second, the effect of substrate concentration was studied by gradually increasing it and keeping the other parameters constant. Finally, the effect of HRT on 4-CP removal efficiency was evaluated by gradually decreasing HRT and keeping 4-CP and peptone concentration constant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Analytical methods</title><p>Biomass concentration was determined by measuring optical density at 600&#x000a0;nm by UV&#x02013;Visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800, Japan) (Ziagova and Liakopoulou-Kyriakides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>). The residual concentration of 4-CP was determined by HPLC system (Jasco, US) coupled with MD-2015 photodiode array detector and 2080 plus isocratic pump.

The bioreactor showed an excellent removal efficiency of 4-CP during continuous operation.</p><p>Before the commencement of the continuous operation, the reactor was operated without inoculation to check the abiotic loss of the 4-CP due to evaporation. The bioreactor was filled with MSM containing 40&#x000a0;mg/L of 4-CP for 1&#x000a0;day, and the air flow was set to 4 LPM. At these conditions, 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;% loss due to evaporation by air flow was observed which is negligible as compared to biodegradation.</p><p>The bioreactor was filled with 12 L MSM containing 20&#x000a0;mg/L of 4CP and inoculated with 10&#x000a0;% (v/v) mixed consortium. The bioreactor was operated in the fed-batch mode before the continuous study to acclimatize the biomass. The 4-CP was added to bioreactor periodically to maintain the 20&#x000a0;mg/L concentration. This acclimatization process was performed for one week and afterwards the continuous operation was started.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Effect of peptone</title><p>The effect of peptone on the removal of 4-CP in ALR was studied throughout the operation at different operating conditions. The bioreactor was started with 1&#x000a0;g/L peptone with HRT of 40&#x000a0;h. The effect of peptone in the removal of 4-CP by ALR is presented in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The bioreactor showed 99&#x000a0;% removal of 20&#x000a0;mg/L of initial 4-CP present in the influent. However, upon increasing the initial 4-CP concentration to 40&#x000a0;mg/L, the removal efficiency was decreased to around 80&#x000a0;% at 40&#x000a0;h HRT. At this condition, when HRT was reduced to 30&#x000a0;h, the removal efficiency was decreased to around 50&#x000a0;% and got stabled at 60&#x000a0;% with 1&#x000a0;g/L peptone. The reduction in removal efficiency can be explained by two possible reasons. First, at lower HRT, dilution rate was increased which leads to washout and reduction of biomass concentration in the medium. Second, at lower HRT, peptone loading rate was increased leading to decreased level of competent biomass in the medium.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>The 4-CP removal by ALR and the effect of peptone concentration.

</p><p>On 15th day of the operation, the peptone concentration was decreased to 0.5&#x000a0;g/L in the influent by keeping initial 4-CP concentration at 40&#x000a0;mg/L and HRT at 30&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The bioreactor showed an increase in removal efficiency from 60 to 76&#x000a0;% in the presence of low peptone concentration at steady-state condition. On 27th day of the operation, the peptone concentration was further decreased to 0.2&#x000a0;g/L in the influent. The HRT was set to 48&#x000a0;h and 4-CP concentration in the influent was increased gradually at this condition. The bioreactor had shown complete removal of 40&#x000a0;mg/L 4-CP. The bioreactor performance had greatly increased in the presence of 0.2&#x000a0;g/L peptone. Even the bioreactor was able to remove up to 400&#x000a0;mg/L of 4-CP in the influent with greater than 98&#x000a0;% removal efficiency. It was observed that the biomass concentration in the medium significantly increased at lower peptone concentration. The result indicates that the mixed consortium can utilize the 4-CP as a carbon source with complete mineralization.</p><p>The presence of higher concentration of peptone interferes with the degradation of 4-CP by the mixed consortium. However, at low peptone concentration, the removal efficiency increased but some peptone was found to be necessary to maintain the removal efficiency. Same results were obtained in batch studies which also showed that the presence of 0.2&#x000a0;g/L of peptone improves the degradation efficiency compared to the absence of peptone. This can be concluded as the peptone served as a nitrogen source to the mixed consortium as it was used during the acclimatization period. Also, the peptone did not contribute to biomass growth as evidenced by the result that the biomass increases with the decrease in peptone concentration and increase in 4-CP concentration. Thus, it could be concluded that the mixed consortium utilized the 4-CP as a carbon source.

</p><p>A specific group of microorganism in the mixed consortium was responsible for the degradation of 4-CP. Sahinkaya and Dilek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>) studied the effect of peptone on the degradation of 4-CP in sequencing batch reactor using a mixed microbial consortium and reported that competent biomass (specialist) is responsible for 4-CP degradation and so the specific degradation rate of 4-CP increases with decreasing peptone concentration as the fraction of competent biomass increases in the mixed consortium (Sahinkaya and Dilek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>). There are several reports on the degradation of chlorophenols in the presence of other carbon and nitrogen source such as glucose, dextrose, peptone, and yeast extract. The presence of secondary carbon and nitrogen source witnessed an increase in the degradation of chlorophenols (Sahinkaya and Dilek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>; Murialdo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2003</xref>; Shen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2005</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2002</xref>; Wang and Loh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1999</xref>). However, there are others reports that publicized the opposing outcomes that sometimes the degradation of higher chlorophenols were inhibited (Durruty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>; Alexander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1999</xref>). Shen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2005</xref>) had described the beneficial nature of the presence of a suitable quantity of microbial easily degradable substrate for stimulating the process of dechlorination and degradation of chlorophenols (Shen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Effect of substrate concentration</title><p>Effect of initial 4-CP concentration on the removal efficiency of bioreactor was studied by keeping the HRT (48&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;h) and peptone concentration (0.2&#x000a0;g/L) constant and gradually increasing 4-CP concentration. The bioreactor showed greater than 99&#x000a0;% removal efficiency when the initial 4-CP concentration was increased from 20 to 400&#x000a0;mg/L. The effect of initial substrate concentration on biodegradation is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> (Day 27&#x02013;47). After 150&#x000a0;mg/L, the 4-CP concentration was increased at a fast rate (150&#x02013;400&#x000a0;mg/L) to check the bioreactor stability for shock loads. The bioreactor has shown great stability and removal efficiency even during the shock loads. At lower concentration of 4-CP, complete mineralization was observed with no traces of the intermediate compounds. However, at higher concentration (above 250&#x000a0;mg/L), the trace amount of 5-chloro 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (5-CHMS) has been observed. The 5-CHMS (<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>
<sub>max</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;380&#x000a0;nm) is the meta-cleavage product of the 4-chlorocatechol that gives a characteristic yellow color in the medium. The bioreactor medium was turned to light yellow color when 4-CP concentration was increased to 400&#x000a0;mg/L due to the accumulation of 5-CHMS. Also, the biomass concentration in the medium was observed to increase with increasing 4-CP concentration. These results indicate that the microorganisms were able to utilize the 4-CP as a sole carbon source.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Effect of HRT</title><p>Effect of HRT on the removal of 4-CP by ALR has been studied from days 47 to 60. The peptone and initial 4-CP concentration was kept constant at 0.2 and 400&#x000a0;g/L, respectively. The change in the biodegradation of 4-CP at different HRT is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. When the HRT was gradually decreased from 48 to 24&#x000a0;h, no abrupt change in the removal efficiency has been observed. The bioreactor showed greater than 99&#x000a0;% removal of 4-CP at 24&#x000a0;h HRT. The presence of 5-CHMS was not observed in the effluent at higher HRT. However, further decrease in HRT to 18&#x000a0;h leads to drastic decrease in biodegradation rate to 50&#x000a0;%. At 18&#x000a0;h HRT, biomass concentration in the bioreactor medium was suddenly decreased as washout occurs and biomass growth rate was decreased. Also, the bioreactor medium has been found to turn into light brown color and 4-CP concentration in the effluent increases suddenly. Effect of different HRT on the volumetric removal rate of 4-CP (400&#x000a0;mg/L) is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The HRT was again increased stepwise to 24 and 30&#x000a0;h to regain the biodegradation capacity of the reactor. The bioreactor takes some time to recover full degradation efficiency. At 24&#x000a0;h HRT, there was a slight increase in biodegradation rate observed. The biodegradation rate was gradually increased to 66&#x000a0;% at steady state when HRT was increased to 30&#x000a0;h. With time and increase in HRT, the bioreactor had showed to regain biodegradation capacity once again.

</p><p>The relationship between volumetric loading rate and volumetric removal rate is depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The removal rate was increased exponentially with loading rate up to 16.67&#x000a0;mg/L/h, where 16.59&#x000a0;mg/L/h volumetric removal rate was observed. However, when loading rate was increased to 22.25&#x000a0;mg/L/h, there was a drastic reduction in volumetric removal rate observed as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. So, for achieving maximum or greater than 98&#x000a0;% removal rate, the HRT should be kept at 24&#x000a0;h and loading rate at 16.67&#x000a0;mg/L/h. Kargi and konya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>) studied the effect of HRT on the removal of 4-CP in activated sludge unit. They have reported volumetric removal rate in the range of 360&#x02013;720&#x000a0;mg/L/day with high COD for different HRT of 5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;h. After 15&#x000a0;h of HRT, there was no significant increase in the removal rate observed (Kargi and Konya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>). In another study, it was reported that degradation of 4-CP was decreased with a decrease in HRT in UASB. The UASB had shown 90.1, 88.3, 84.6, and 83&#x000a0;% degradation of 4-CP at 16, 12, 8, and 6&#x000a0;h, respectively (Majumder and Gupta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>). Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the performance of different bioreactors for removal of chlorophenols where most of the studies had shown the removal of 4-CP below 200&#x000a0;mg/L of loading rate. Kargi and Konya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>) had shown the removal of 4-CP up to 800&#x000a0;mg/L of loading rate with 90&#x000a0;% efficiency (Kargi and Konya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>). In the present study, the bioreactor had achieved 99.8&#x000a0;% removal for higher loading rate of 400&#x000a0;mg/L/day. The performance of the ALR for removal of 4-CP is prominent and can successfully applied for contaminated wastewater treatment.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Effect of loading rate on the volumetric removal of 4-CP in the ALR with 0.2&#x000a0;g/L of peptone</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_435_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Metabolites</title><p>During the biodegradation of 4-CP by airlift inner loop reactor, the spectroscopic and HPLC analysis indicates the presence of 5-CHMS in the effluent. At lower 4-CP concentration, no metabolites had been detected in the effluent. However, at higher 4-CP concentration, the presence of 5-CHMS (<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>
<sub>max</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;380&#x000a0;nm) was detected. This was also evidenced by the appearance of light yellow color in the reactor medium. 5-CHMS is the meta-cleavage product of the 4-chlorocatechol, the first intermediate of the 4-CP degradation pathway. When 4-CP concentration is above 300&#x000a0;mg/L, the calorimetric assay of the effluent sample shows the presence of 4-chlorocatechol. The presence of metabolites showed that the mixed consortium follows the meta-cleavage pathway for 4-CP biodegradation. There were no other metabolites detected in the effluent. These results were also confirmed in the batch study. The degradation of 4-CP via meta-cleavage pathway by the mixed consortium has been reported (Farrell and Quilty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>; El-Sayed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>).</p><p>Single bacterial strain can degrade toxic compounds completely if provided the feasible environment and presence of primary growth substrate. However, sometimes pure strain does not possess or express all the enzymes required for complete mineralization of toxic compounds. They specifically express the enzymes that act on parent compounds and produce the intermediate metabolites. These intermediate metabolites remain in the medium unutilized, because the lack of enzymes requires in the metabolic pathway. Also, application of pure strains for in situ environment is impractical as the dominance of other strains over the special strains that are better fitted for the degradation of target compound. In nature or engineered system, microbial communities are responsible for the complete mineralization of the toxic compounds. The several species present act together in a coordinated way within the microbial community that leads to complete degradation of recalcitrant compounds. Also, mixed microbial consortium does not require the presence of other primary growth substrate such as phenol or carbon source for complete degradation or induction of enzymes for the transformation of target toxic compound. A better understanding of the role that microorganisms play in the biodegradation and removal of chlorophenol compounds from the environment could facilitate further research for effective implementation of bioremediation technologies for the contaminated sites. Specific treatment proficiency can enable removal of chlorophenols from the environment and subsequently their ecotoxicological effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An airlift bioreactor was evaluated for the removal of 4-chlorophenol&#x000a0;in synthetic wastewater using the mixed microbial consortium isolated from the dye industries. The results demonstrated that different parameters such as hydraulic retention time, initial substrate concentration, and peptone as biogenic substrate have profound effect on 4-CP removal efficiency. The bioreactor showed an excellent removal efficiency for 4-CP throughout the operation with greater than 98&#x000a0;% removal. The optimum hydraulic retention time for the bioreactor was found to be 24&#x000a0;h and below that the washout of the microbes observed. Effect of peptone showed that lower peptone concentration increases the removal efficiency; however, some peptone is necessary to maintain 4-CP removal efficiency. The maximum initial substrate concentration of 400&#x000a0;mg/L of 4-CP was efficiently removed up to 99&#x000a0;% at 24&#x000a0;h HRT and 0.2&#x000a0;g/L peptone. The presence of 5-CHMS at a higher 4-CP concentration in the bioreactor establishes that the mixed consortium follows the meta-cleavage pathway. The stability and efficiency showed by the mixed consortium for different operating conditions indicate its suitability for in situ bioremediation over a pure strain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Department of Chemical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela.</p></ack><notes
