Differential Display (DDRT-PCR) is a powerful technique for analyzing differences in gene expression. In-vivo expression technologies and differential display RT-PCR are providing new approaches to further examine a microbe&#x02019;s response to experimental conditions which more closely resemble natural microbial associations and habitats. In this study, <italic>Bacillus endophyticus</italic> strain SA isolated from the inner tissue of the stem of the cultivated plant (<italic>Salvadora persica</italic>, Asir, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) produces an antagonistic factor. This factor has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and specifically against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). The antagonistic factor was isolated from the bacterial culture medium and purified by thin layer chromatography technique, then analyzed by GC&#x02013;MS analysis. Identification of the producer strain was performed using the partial nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene, which indicated that this strain is identical to <italic>B. endophyticus</italic> with 99&#x000a0;% similarity. The sequence of this strain was deposited at NCBI GenBank under accession number KF011545. Application of differential display RT-PCR revealed that the isolate was able to up-regulate a gene with serine protease like protein. The protein is well known as antimicrobial agent and was reported to be produced by plants, animals and insects. Serine protease is also known to be produced by bacteria for purposes oth
er than bacterial&#x02013;bacterial antagonistic effect, which has been confirmed by this study.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Endophytic</kwd><kwd><italic>Bacillus endophyticus</italic></kwd><kwd>Methicillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>GC&#x02013;MS</kwd><kwd>Differential display RT-PCR</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>King Khaled University</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endophytes have been defined as microorganisms (bacteria or fungi) which for all or part of their life cycle reside within the inner parts of plant tissues, but cause no symptoms of disease (Vega et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>; Khan and Doty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>). They play an important role in the plant health preservation in addition to their ability to supplement their host plants with inorganic nutrients via nitrogen fixation and iron solubilization processes (Porras-Soriano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>). In addition, these microorganisms play an important role to protect their host plants from phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria (Emmert and Handelsman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1999</xref>). They are able to antagonize the pathogenic microbes through the competition for space and nutrients, production of antibiotics, production of hydrolytic enzymes and by inducing plant defense mechanisms (Ryan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; Strobel and Long <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1998</xref>; Wipat and Harwood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1998</xref>).

Plant surface sterilization is necessary to avoid the co-contamination with superficial bacteria. Using of ethanol and sodium hypochlorite at certain dilutions is recommended for complete removal of the plant surface bacteria (Jan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). Miswak stem parts were surface sterilized followed by the isolation of inner bacterial isolates on NA plates. About ten bacterial colonies with the same colony shape and characteristics were obtained. One of the colonies was chosen and transferred to a new NA plate to ensure complete purification. The purified bacterium was checked for its ability to antagonize some human pathogenic bacteria including <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA). Sterile filter papers loaded by approximately 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/ml of the isolate broth were posted to the surface of pathogens spread plates. The antagonistic effect was only observed with <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), where 2&#x000a0;cm diameter clear zone was recorded.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Antagonistic effect of endophytic isolate (SA) against <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) on a nutrient agar plate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_439_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

It was observed that 9 of the tested antibiotics hadn&#x02019;t revealed any kind of antibacterial activity compared with 1.2&#x000a0;cm clear zone recorded by the endophytic isolate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b). These results confirm the common concept regarding the ability of microorganism to develop new strategies to resist more and more antibiotics, which invite the researchers to find new and effective antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, only chloramphenicol recorded 2.3&#x000a0;cm clear zone that seems to be two times higher than that recorded with our isolate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Although chloramphenicol showed higher activity than our endophytic isolate; the antagonistic activity of this isolate is more preferred than this antibiotic. Later treatment of MRSA strains could be achieved using the bioactive components produced by our endophytic isolate with prohibition of antibiotics especially chloramphenicol. The reasons for this hypothesis came from that there are many recorded disadvantages of chloramphenicol including the risk of its side effects, rising of resistance rates and uncomfortable posology (Diniz-Santos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Antibacterial effects of antibiotics compared with endophytic isolate SA against <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), <bold>a</bold> Cefadroxil, Clarithromycin, Metronidazole, Cefotaxime and Sulphamathoxazole compared with Endophytic isolate, <bold>b</bold> Cefazolin, Chloramphenicol, Cefoxitin, Roxithromycin and Clindamycin compared with Endophytic isolate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_439_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

The PCR amplified gene was purified and submitted for sequencing (Macrogen, Korea). The gene sequence revealed that the isolate is 99&#x000a0;% similar to <italic>Bacillus endophyticus</italic>. The sequence was deposited in GenBank with accession number KF011545. Multiple sequence alignment, molecular phylogeny and phylogenetic tree were performed using MEGA 5 software (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>PCR of the 16S rRNA amplified gene, <italic>M</italic> 1&#x000a0;kb DNA ladder; <italic>E</italic> amplified gene product of the endophytic isolate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_439_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Unveiling of up-regulated or down-regulated genes</title><p>Any external effect on the organism can affect its genetic behavior in a way of over or down expression of the genes according to the kind of the stimulant. The number and extent of the genes affected is not totally known to others. Differential display can offer some favors regarding this point, especially in the identification of some up-regulated or down-regulated genes under specific conditions. The discovery of these affecting genes is related to the sequence of the primers used during the reverse transcription process. We have used different primers that help to amplify different genes, whether over expressed or down expressed at the co-presence of antagonistic isolate and the pathogen. In our study, four up-regulated and down-regulated genes were chosen for gel purification and sequencing. However, only one of the sequenced genes was matched with genes deposited in GenBank. This gene was up-regulated, excised from the gel and submitted for gene sequencing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The obtained sequence revealed that the concerned gene is serine protease-like gene. Serine protease is an enzyme that produced by many organisms including bacteria. It is widely produced by <italic>Bacillus</italic> species and found tremendous applications in pharmaceuticals (Bhunia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>

</p><p>Serine protease has been produced by many organisms, including plants, animals and microbes (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>; Sakanari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1989</xref>). Verma and Verma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>) reported the isolation and purification of antimicrobial peptide from celomic fluid of Indian earthworm <italic>Pheretima posthumous</italic>. They identified the isolated peptide as serine protease that possesses a broad range of antimicrobial activity. The bacterial production and secretion of serine protease for antimicrobial function is not yet documented. However, we strongly propose that our isolate was able to produce serine protease for antimicrobial purpose. This claim is highly supported by the conditions which allow this enzyme not only to be produced but also to be over expressed. To our knowledge, this is the first study that illustrates the bacterial production of serine protease for antagonistic function against another genus of bacteria.</p></sec></sec><sec
