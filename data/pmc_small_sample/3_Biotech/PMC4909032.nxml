A 7.9-fold increase in lipase-specific activity was recorded after purification by DEAE Sepharose ion exchange and Sephadex G200 column chromatography.

The lipase activity was stable in the presence of surfactants such as cetrimonium bromide, sodium dodecyl sulphate and Tween 80, and metal ions and reagents such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup> and 2-mercaptoethanol. However, the activity was greatly reduced in the presence of organic solvents such as chloroform. The stain removal potential of the crude lipase was determined on polycotton fabric pieces stained with peanut oil. Lipase added to cold water alone significantly enhanced the removal of stain by 152&#x000a0;%. The addition of lipase also improved the stain removal efficiency of a commercially available detergent in the presence of either cold (25&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) or hot (65&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) water.

Lipases from microorganisms are considered better than those obtained from plants or animals because of faster production, higher yields and greater stability. The enzyme production can be enhanced by selection of potent strains, genetic manipulation and optimization of growth conditions (Dayanandan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>).</p><p>High production cost of lipase is a major hurdle in its application in industrial processes. Therefore, various attempts have been made to lower the cost of its production (Smaniotto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>). Fungi are usually preferred as lipase producers because they synthesize extracellular enzymes that can be easily extracted from the production media (Maia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1999</xref>). However, the synthesis of fungal lipases is governed by both nutritional and physico-chemical parameters such as pH, temperature and level of dissolved oxygen.</p><p>Some of the applications of lipases include synthesis of organic chemicals, flavour enhancement during cheese production and treatment of high fat-containing waste water (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>). Fungal lipases are extensively used in the detergent industries for removal of tough oily stains from fabrics. Rapid degradation of oils with better specificity even under mild conditions has made these enzymes useful in the formulation of soaps and production of biosurfactants (Gopinath et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>). However, very few studies which discuss the characterization of surfactant-compatible fungal lipases are available. A detailed analysis of lipase properties facilitates its application in relevant industrial processes (Borrelli and Trono <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). Owing to the continuous demand for fungal lipases in various industrial sectors, the present study was undertaken with the objectives of purification, characterization and determination of the oil-destaining potential of lipase from a selected fungal isolate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Source of fungal strain, substrates and chemicals</title><p>A lipolytic fungal strain, isolated from rhizospheric soil, was obtained from the Department of Microbiology, Center for Post Graduate Studies, Jain University, Bangalore, India.

The fungal isolate was identified as <italic>Aspergillus tamarii</italic> JGIF06 (GenBank Accession No. KR259959) by partial 18S rDNA sequencing at Chromous Biotech Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India. Pure culture of the fungus was maintained on potato dextrose agar slants and stored at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until use.

Polycotton fabric was cut into pieces (3&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;cm) and each piece was stained with two drops of peanut oil used for deep frying.

A high lipase activity (23,666.66&#x000a0;U/ml/min) was recorded in the culture filtrate. The positive impact of coconut oil on lipase production by <italic>A. tamarii</italic> JGIF06 might be attributed to its high content (92&#x000a0;%) of saturated fatty acids (primarily triglycerides). About 70&#x000a0;% of these are short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids (Ribeiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>). The short- and medium-chain fatty acids are utilized by fungi through the carnitine-independent transport system (Hynes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>; Son et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>). Khoramnia et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>) also reported maximum lipolytic activity from <italic>Geotrichum candidum</italic> when coconut oil was used as the substrate.</p><p>A combination of organic (tryptone) and inorganic (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) nitrogen supplements in the production medium facilitated a high yield of lipase. This might be due to faster assimilation of inorganic nitrogen source by the fungal mycelia and enrichment of the production medium with several growth factors and amino acids derived from the organic nitrogen source. The current finding is in agreement with Bindiya and Ramana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>) who reported that among various inorganic sources, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl supplementation showed the best lipase production from olive oil by <italic>Aspergillus sydowii</italic>.</p><p>Incorporation of cationic surfactant CTAB in the medium probably altered the cell permeability, thereby enhancing the enzyme secretion. A similar result was reported by Polizelli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>), who observed that the activity of lipase from <italic>Pachira</italic>

The enzyme retained 63 and 50&#x000a0;% of its activity at 45 and 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, respectively. The current finding is supported by Hiol et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>) who observed that the optimum temperature for activity of a lipase from <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic> was 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and 65&#x000a0;% of its activity was retained after 30&#x000a0;min of incubation at 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Substrate specificity of the lipase</title><p>Six different vegetable oils were analysed for determining the substrate specificity of the lipase. Among these, maximum lipase activity was revealed with peanut oil (48,333.33 U/ml/min) followed by sesame oil and coconut oil (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The results of substrate specificity clearly indicated the versatile ability of this fungal lipase to act on different vegetable oils with moderately high contents of unsaturated fatty acids (75&#x02013;80&#x000a0;% in sesame and peanut oils) as well as those with very high content of saturated fatty acids (86&#x000a0;% in coconut oil). A study conducted by Rahman et al.

As the substrate concentration increases, the active sites of the enzyme molecules get saturated. Since the standard lipase assay was conducted using olive oil, the effect of substrate concentration on lipase activity was determined through Michaelis&#x02013;Menten equation and Lineweaver&#x02013;Burk plot using olive oil as the substrate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).

The lipase from <italic>A. tamarii</italic> JGIF06 retained 90.84&#x000a0;% of its activity in the presence of CTAB, while the lowest residual activity was recorded with Tween 20 (71.83&#x000a0;%), compared to 100&#x000a0;% activity shown by the control (without any surfactant) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The results indicated the potentiality of the lipase to tolerate various surfactants like SDS, CTAB and Tween 80. The activity of a lipase produced by endophytic fungus <italic>Cercospora kikuchii</italic> was stable in the presence of surfactants such as Tween 20, Tween 80, SDS and Triton X-100, wherein 98&#x02013;100&#x000a0;% of enzymatic activity was retained (Costa-Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Effect of salts and reagents</title><p>Enzymes require metal ions as co-factors in various metabolic pathways. The results showed a slight increase in the enzyme activity in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, whereas 92&#x000a0;% activity was retained with BaCl<sub>2</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). With the other metal ions, the residual lipase activities ranged between 71 and 76&#x000a0;%. Chartrain et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1993</xref>) observed that a lipase from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> MB 5001 was stimulated (1.24-fold) by adding 10&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, but was strongly inhibited by 1&#x000a0;mM ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (94&#x000a0;% inhibition). In this study, the residual lipase activity was minimum (66.19&#x000a0;%) when pre-incubated in 10&#x000a0;mM EDTA. EDTA probably chelated the metal ions present with the enzyme, thereby denaturing the enzyme. Interestingly, the activity of the lipase was relatively stable in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The resistance of the fungal lipase to 2-mercaptoethanol might indicate the presence of a lesser number of disulphide bonds exposed on the enzyme surface. A similar observation was made by Yadav et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1998</xref>) who reported that lipase from <italic>A. terreus</italic> was unaffected by 2-mercaptoethanol and potassium ferrocyanide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Effect of organic solvents</title><p>Pre-incubation of the fungal lipase with each of the organic solvents showed a drastic reduction in its activity (in the range of 3.5&#x02013;7.7&#x000a0;%) as compared to the control (100&#x000a0;%). The activity decreased in the following order: 2-propanol&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;acetone&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;ethanol&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;methanol&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;chloroform. The reduction in lipase activity when incubated with organic solvents might be due to the dehydrating action of organic solvents which would have removed water molecules from the vicinity of the enzyme, thus precipitating the enzyme which adversely affected its activity. In addition, all the organic solvents might have caused denaturation of the amino acid residues present in the enzyme molecule. Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>) reported that the activities of lipases from <italic>Rhizopus</italic> sp. were reduced in the presence of polar solvents like ethanol and <italic>i</italic>-propanol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Oil-destaining efficiency of the lipase</title><p>Polycotton fabric pieces were stained with peanut oil. Peanut oil is usually preferred for deep frying because it is relatively stable with a high smoke point (Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>). This explains the rationale behind the use of peanut oil in the present study to obtain tough stains on the fabric pieces. The oil-stained fabric pieces were subjected to different combinations of lipolytic treatments involving cold or hot water, detergent and lipase. Oil-destaining activity was least for the treatment involving only plain cold water, indicating its inefficiency (166.66 U/ml/min) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Treatment with hot water alone did not promote efficient removal of oil stains. However, an increase in lipolytic activity was recorded when combinations of cold or hot water and detergent were used. Furthermore, even in the absence of detergent, the lipolytic activity was significantly enhanced by 152 and 17.4&#x000a0;% on addition of crude fungal lipase to cold and hot water, respectively. Treatments involving cold or hot water, lipase and detergent showed further enhancement in lipolytic activity, with the highest destaining potential (29,000&#x000a0;U/ml/min) recorded with hot water. Following various lipolytic treatments, it was evident that addition of the crude lipase resulted in significant enhancement in stain removal efficiency of a commercially available detergent compared to lower lipolytic activity (13,000&#x000a0;U/ml/min) and stain removal capacity of hot water with only detergent. This result clearly indicated the detergent-compatible nature of the fungal lipase. However, the lipolytic activities observed following various treatments with hot water did not reveal any significant difference from those obtained with cold water. It could be interpreted that the crude lipase was effective in removing oil stains even at moderately cold temperature, thereby reducing energy consumption. This indicates the possibility of its application in energy-efficient systems. Hemachander and Puvanakrishnan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2000</xref>) had reported that in the presence of a detergent, a lipase produced by <italic>Ralstonia pickettii</italic> enhanced the removal of oil by 24&#x02013;27&#x000a0;% compared to treatment with only detergent. In an earlier study, a lipase from <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> was found compatible with various surfactants and commercial detergents (Prazeres et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Oil-destaining efficiency of various lipolytic treatments on oil-stained fabric pieces.
