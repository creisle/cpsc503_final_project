The isolation of good quality and quantity of total community DNA are one of the major hurdles in this endeavour. Shearing of DNA during the extraction process and the co-extraction of inhibitory compounds reduce the quality of the isolated nucleic acids making it unsuitable for the construction of large insert metagenomic libraries. In the present study, a multi-level filtration step was brought in which efficiently isolated total bacterial DNA from three different environment samples. The preprocessing method could efficiently improve the 260/230 ratio of the isolated DNA by 2.3&#x02013;45&#x000a0;% and decreased the protein contamination by 22.5&#x02013;34.5&#x000a0;% on saltpan and arctic sediment samples, respectively. The more significant part of the experiment was that the DNA obtained was of high quality with minimal shearing making it most suitable for the construction of large insert genomic libraries. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene confirmed that the filtration method was effective in the isolation of high-quality DNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Preprocessing</kwd><kwd>High molecular weight DNA</kwd><kwd>DNA isolation</kwd><kwd>Metagenomic DNA</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001851</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Earth Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MoES/10-MLR/01/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philip</surname><given-names>Rosamma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metagenomic approach provides access to microbial genomics and their function which helps in the exploitation of novel biocatalysts from unculturable microbial communities of various ecosystems. Community DNA isolation from different marine environments is a challenging process, since the ecosystems are extremely diverse and contain inhibitory compounds, such as humic acids. Ecosystems, such as mangroves, salt pans, and Arctic deserve, much attention in terms of metagenomic studies due to its uniqueness. Mangroves are productive marine ecosystems and biologically important intertidal zones rich in nutrient content and micro flora. Microbial community found in mangrove sediments is a potent source of important biocatalysts that enable them to live in adverse conditions. Salt pans are manmade ecosystems with extreme conditions, where microorganisms survive at very high salinities with intense solar radiations. Arctic regions are characterized by extremely low temperature, and serve as an important source of isolation of psychrophilic/psychrotolerant microbes, and also cold-adapted enzymes. Metagenomics is a very potent tool for the analysis of these extreme habitats harboring organisms that are often difficult to cultivate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Surface sediment samples were collected from saltpans (Lat: 15&#x000b0;29&#x02032;57.12&#x02033;N and Long: 73&#x000b0;50&#x02032;49.06&#x02033;E) of Ribander, Goa and mangrove areas (Lat: 9&#x000b0;54&#x02032;N and Long: 76&#x000b0;17&#x02032;60&#x02033;E) in Cochin, Kerala. Arctic sediment samples (Lat: 78&#x000b0;99&#x02032;31&#x02033;N and Long: 12&#x000b0;3&#x02032;00&#x02033;E) were collected during the Summer Arctic Expedition of NCAOR (2014) from Kongsfjorden, Arctic.

The 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc; filter paper with the residue (the bacterial fraction) was then washed with an extraction buffer [100&#x000a0;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 100&#x000a0;mM EDTA, (pH 8.0), 100&#x000a0;mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 1.5&#x000a0;M NaCl] supplemented with 0.1&#x000a0;% tween 20 to collect the bacterial biomass.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>). DNA isolated after preprocessing of the sediment was compared with that isolated directly without any treatment. Comparative analysis revealed considerable variations in yield and purity of DNA obtained from the different samples (preprocessed and normal). With respect to purity, 260/280 ratio of DNA samples from processed samples were 1.9 and 1.65 for arctic and saltpan samples, respectively, compared to 1.21 and 1.2 obtained by the direct method (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, DNA from arctic sediment has A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>230</sub> ratio close to optimum, indicating DNA with comparatively reduced humic acid content obtained by filtration method.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Purity of DNA (A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub>) from different marine environments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_482_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

</p><p>Concentration of the DNA based on the spectrophotometric observations showed that DNA extracted from the preprocessed mangrove sediment yielded 0.779&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g sediment while those of saltpan and arctic were 0.476 and 0.088&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g, respectively. The yield of DNA from samples without preprocessing was 283.2, 33.25, and 9.69&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g for mangrove, saltpan, and arctic sediments, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The increase in yield of DNA in the non-processed samples may be due to the presence of eukaryotic organisms with more DNA content, as we had selectively taken only the bacterial fraction in the preprocessed samples. Comparative analysis revealed that the yield of DNA obtained from the preprocessed samples of arctic and saltpan environments was less but with high quality and less humic acid content than DNA isolated directly from the samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For mangrove samples, DNA yield was high in the case of direct isolation but with high humic acid content and low quality with high shearing. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene was carried out to verify the purity of the isolates, which clearly depicted that the preprocessing of the sediment gave DNA of higher quality as evidenced from the bands on the electrophoretogram (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Yield of DNA (&#x003bc;g/g) from different marine environments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Yield of DNA (&#x003bc;g/g)</th><th align="left">Arctic</th><th align="left">Saltpan</th><th align="left">Mangrove</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Sediment sample (normal)</td><td char="." align="char">9.69</td><td char="." align="char">33.25</td><td char="." align="char">283.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sediment sample (preprocessed)</td><td char="." align="char">0.088</td><td char="." align="char">0.476</td><td char="." align="char">0.779</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p>The sediment samples under the current experiment were rich in microorganisms as well as organic matter especially humic acids which denature DNA by binding phenolic groups to amides. The presence of humic substances in DNA samples, interfere in enzyme-mediated molecular processes, such as digestion, and amplification and ligation in metagenomic library construction (Paul and Clark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1989</xref>; Robe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>; Whitehouse and Hottel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). Since downstream processes in molecular biology demand good quantity of inhibitor-free metagenomic DNA, extraction methods have high significance (Siddhapura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). Numerous DNA extraction methods in vogue had been discussed and practiced for the isolation of DNA from soil (Bruce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1992</xref>; Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>; Kuske et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1998</xref>; Yeates et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>; Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>; Bertrand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>; Desai and Madamwar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>). However, the major problem is the humic acid contamination and shearing of DNA that makes it unsuitable for the construction of large insert libraries. Use of polyvinyl pyrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl polypyrolidone (PVPP), CTAB, and PEG has been helpful in reducing the load of humic and fulvic acids along with that of DNA, but it significantly reduces the yield. Purdy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1996</xref>) used PEG to precipitate DNA which significantly reduced humate contamination, but its yield was significantly less compared to that of alcohol precipitation (Krsek and wellington <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1999</xref>). Krsek and wellington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1999</xref>) also suggested the comparative reduction in the co-extraction of humic substances by the use of low amounts of SDS and EDTA during DNA isolation. Harry et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1999</xref>) suggested the use of electrophoretic methods to be the best for the separation of humic acid from DNA. The presence of high levels of phenolic compounds in crude DNA extracts even after consistent purification by electrophoresis decreased the PCR amplification. Abu Al-Soud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2000</xref>) explained the use of BSA along with the PCR mix to improve the amplification. The use of several columns and beads of Sepharose significantly reduced the humate load, but it significantly reduced the amount of DNA which can lead to a misrepresentation of the microflora in the system. The use of beads and columns also results in extensive physical strain that shears the DNA making it not suitable for the construction of large insert libraries. The use of gel-plus-minicolumn and gel-plus-concentrator methods (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>), Sephadex G-200 spin column purification (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>), and cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient centrifugation (Bertrand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>) is laborious, time-consuming, and result in significant DNA loss. Miller et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>) also stated that the serial dilution of DNA reduced the concentration of PCR inhibitors.</p><p>The successful recovery of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA and its quality is a mandate for the molecular analysis to access the large pool of genomic information encoded within the metagenome (Ward et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1990</xref>; Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>). Construction of large insert metagenomic library is currently used as a genomic approach to study the physiology of unculturable microorganisms (Rondon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>; Liles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>). Isolation of HMW DNA is important in the construction of metagenomic libraries, as it increases the possibilities of retaining a complete genetic machinery needed for a biosynthetic pathway (Bertrand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>). It also helps to reduce the risk of chimera formation during PCR amplification (Liesack and Stackebrandt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1992</xref>).</p><p>In this study, sediment samples from saltpan, mangrove, and arctic environments were preprocessed to remove inhibitory substances, such as humic acid and fulvic acid, from the sediment samples. The preprocessing steps involved sequential multistage filtration. Sediment samples were treated with saline water, subjected to low-speed centrifugation and filtered through filter membranes to retain the microbes. DNA was extracted from the bacterial fraction on the filter membranes. DNA extracted from this modified filtration method was compared with the DNA samples isolated without any preprocessing. The preprocessing could efficiently improve the 260/230 ratio of the isolated DNA by 2.3&#x02013;45&#x000a0;% which depicts the reduction in the co-isolation of humic acid and it showed a pronounced decrease in the protein contamination by 22.5&#x02013;34.5&#x000a0;% on saltpan and arctic sediment samples, respectively. The most significant observation was that preprocessing also helped to reduce the shearing of genomic DNA which is needed for the downstream molecular analyses, such as PCR and large insert genomic library construction without further purification or selection steps. The quality and purity of the metagenomic DNA were evaluated based on the PCR efficacy analysis, as <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase is sensitive to contaminants, such as humic acid (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>), and it clearly showed that the preprocessing could yield DNA with a better quality as evident from the strength of the amplicons in comparison with those isolated directly. Earlier reports showed the need of 1000&#x02013;10,000-fold dilution of metagenomic DNA for a successful amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. Hence, the PCR efficacy analysis also clearly showed that the metagenomic DNA isolated contained relatively low concentration of PCR inhibitory substances and has sufficient purity for PCR without the need for further purification as compared to other DNA extraction methods (Borneman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1996</xref>; Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>; Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>; Bertrand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Salient findings include high-quality DNA from arctic and saltpan regions by the preprocessing of the sediment samples. In the present study, the metagenomic DNA isolated (without preprocessing) from sediments were found to have high yield, but high humic acid contamination. Saline washing, centrifugation, and repeated filtration of the sediment samples prior to cell lysis and DNA extraction resulted in the isolation of high molecular weight DNA with moderate yield, high purity with less shearing, and was found suitable for large insert metagenomic library construction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) for financial support under MoES/10-MLR/01 scheme.
