It involves the combination of an active substance, i.e., a photosensitizer, light and molecular oxygen to achieve the purpose. This method is slowly taking over the existing conventional disinfection methods like chlorination, UV and ozone due to the drawbacks associated with these latter techniques. For instance, chlorination, the most widely used disinfection method suffers from the formation of disinfection by-products which have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on mammals (Marugan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>; Pablos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>). On the other hand, ozone the most powerful disinfectant among chemical disinfectants is not feasible due to its escape from the water during the application thereby posing threat to the health of operators and the environment even at a concentration as low as 0.03&#x000a0;gm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> (Acher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1997</xref>), whereas UV treatment is considered costly and its exposure causes mutations.</p><p>During the last one decade a large number of photosensitizers have been tested in vitro and in vivo mainly focussing on their antimicrobial efficiency in relation to the structure of these compounds (Luksiene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>). Photosensitizers on absorbing visible light enter into its excited state and can effect electron transfer reactions (Redox reactions) (Type I), also direct transfer of energy to ground state oxygen forms toxic singlet oxygen (Type II) which are responsible for bacterial inactivation (Wainwright and Crossley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001">2004</xref>). Few studies have reported that Gram positive bacteria are susceptible to any kind of dye, cationic, anionic or neutral, whereas Gram negative bacteria show resistance due to the presence of lipopolysaccharide coat that presents a physical and chemical barrier to singlet oxygen species produced outside the cells, which must enter the cell to interact with vital targets such as membrane or cytoplasmic components in order to inactivate these bacteria (Dahl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1989</xref>). To render these bacteria susceptible to photo-inactivation, permeability of their outer membrane can be increased by some pre-treatment step using either chemical or biological agents (Valduga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>). On the other hand, cationic dyes are found efficient in inactivating both the kinds of bacteria (Alves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>) but are in general more efficient against Gram positive bacteria (Ergaieg and Seux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>). Some studies have also been conducted on the effect of simple parameters like concentration of photosensitizer by Ergaieg and Seux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>) which showed an increase in inactivation kinetics with increase in photosensitizer concentration whereas a study by Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>) showed alkaline pH of microbial suspension to be more effective for inactivation under visible light; however, to our knowledge, no investigation has been carried out focussing on the combined effect of these parameters which is essential for a better understanding of the process as well as for its successful scale up applications.</p><p>This work, therefore, aimed to study the combined effect of concentration of photo sensitizer, pH of the cell suspension and viable cell count employing the statistically valid full factorial design of experiments. It is expected that all the three parameters will show some significant combined effects on bacterial inactivation. Also the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its effect on bacteria is studied. The bacterial strains used in this photo-inactivation study were <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. hirae</italic>; the photosensitizers tested were methylene blue (MB) and sodium anthraquinone-2-sulphonate (SAQS). <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. hirae</italic> are known as non-pathogenic indicator microorganisms whose presence in water indicates the possible presence of pathogenic microorganisms. <italic>E. coli</italic> is indicator of fecal contamination whereas <italic>E. hirae</italic> is indicator of contamination due to surface runoff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>The photosensitizers (PS), methylene blue (MB) and sodium anthraquinone-2-sulphonate (SAQS) used in this study were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, India. These photosensitizers were chosen due to their cationic nature. Bacterial growth media, such as nutrient broth, brain heart infusion broth and agar were procured from Merck (India). Analytical reagents propidium iodide, dihydrochlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA), tri carboxylic acid (TCA), guanidine hydrochloride and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, India and other chemicals thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) and 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxy propane were obtained from Merck (India).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Microorganisms and culture conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (MTCC 1610) and <italic>Enterococcus hirae</italic> (MTCC 3612) were obtained from IMTECH, Chandigarh, India. <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown in nutrient broth, whereas <italic>E. hirae</italic> was cultured using brain heart infusion broth both at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 180&#x000a0;rpm for 24&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inactivation experiments</title><p>Batch experiments in this study were carried out as per the statistically valid 2<sup>3</sup> full factorial design by varying the concentration of PS, pH of the bacterial suspension and initial cell count as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

</p><p>All the inactivation experiments were carried out in triplicate by transferring 1&#x000a0;mL of 24&#x000a0;h grown bacterial culture (<italic>E. hirae</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic>) into 1.5&#x000a0;mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuging the biomass at 10,000&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 10&#x000a0;min. The pellets obtained were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) of respective initial pH and re-suspended in PBS having different initial pH 7.5, 8.25, 9.0, as per the design (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) followed by serial dilution up to 1000 times. PBS composition used was 8&#x000a0;g/L NaCl, 0.2&#x000a0;g/L KCl, 1.44&#x000a0;g/L Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and 0.25&#x000a0;g/L KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and its pH was adjusted using 0.1&#x000a0;N HCl and 0.1&#x000a0;N NaOH. From these PBS suspended cultures a set of control experiments were carried out without addition of MB and SAQS for counting initial CFU and the other suspended cultures were added with MB and SAQS from their respective 1&#x000a0;mM stock solution to ensure initial concentration in the range of 0.73&#x02013;1.25&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L as per the experimental design (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). One set of mixtures was kept in dark for 30&#x000a0;min and the other set of mixtures was kept under dark condition on a gel rocker platform for three different incubation periods of 5, 15 and 30&#x000a0;min with constant shaking. For MB mediated inactivation, a commercially available 11&#x000a0;W compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) with a light intensity of 2700&#x000a0;lx in a closed chamber was used as the light source. The exposure period was 10&#x000a0;min and the emitted light wavelength was well within the visible light range (400&#x02013;700&#x000a0;nm), which correlated well with the MB absorbance wavelength. In case of SAQS mediated inactivation in this study, a commercially available 6&#x000a0;W Philips&#x02122; blacklight blue tube with IEC value of 0.88&#x000a0;W and a light intensity of 20&#x000a0;lx in a closed chamber was used as the UV-A source which matched with the photosensitizer absorbance wavelength. Control experiments carried out using these respective light sources and either only the photosensitizers or the bacteria revealed negligible effect on both. Bacterial suspensions (10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L) from all sets of mixtures were then spread on brain heart infusion agar and nutrient agar plates for <italic>E. hirae</italic> and <italic>E. coli,</italic> respectively, and incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x000a0;h.

</p><p>The photo-inactivation efficiency of the bacteria increased with an increase in the PS concentration and a higher dilution of the bacteria (i.e., 1000 times initial viable cell count).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Mechanism of photo-inactivation</title><p>The decrease in bacterial cell viability due to the cationic photo-sensitizers (MB and SAQS) is attributed to the positive charge of these molecules that favors its binding at critical cellular sites which once damaged by exposure to light causes the inactivation of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria (Jori and Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>). It has been reported that positive charge on PS promotes electrostatic interaction with negatively charged sites at the outer surface of the bacterial cells which increases their photo-inactivation efficiency (Caminos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). However, the results obtained (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) showed that both the cationic photo-sensitizers (MB and SAQS) are more efficient against <italic>E. hirae</italic> than <italic>E. coli.</italic> This is mainly attributed to the presence of outer lipopolysaccharide layer in Gram negative bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> that helps the bacteria avoid or limit the uptake of the photo-sensitizers and/or the reactive oxygen species produced by these compounds thereby escaping from the photo-inactivation process (Dahl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1989</xref>; Ergaieg and Seux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>).</p><p>The photo-inactivation results were further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of the PS treated bacteria. As propidium iodide is not permeable through the intact cell membrane, it only gets internalized and binds to DNA of the cells whose membranes are compromised. Hence, the shift in the fluorescence peaks of propidium iodide added with PS treated bacteria from the standard peak represented the fact that the cell membrane in these bacteria was damaged thereby leading to their inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Effect of parameters</title><p>PS initial concentration strongly influenced the photo-inactivation of microorganisms (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), suggesting that the effect is due to either an increase in the quantum yield of reactive oxygen species (Ergaieg and Seux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>) or profound interaction of the PS with bacterial surface or both (Jori and Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>). pH, on the other hand, showed its significant effect only at a higher level (alkaline pH) and at a prolonged incubation period (30&#x000a0;min) in dark. Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>) reported that MB is more effective under basic pH than under acidic condition probably due to its transition between singlet and triplet states. The effect of pH was not significant for a short dark incubation period of 5&#x000a0;min probably due to insufficient contact time for interaction between the PS and the bacteria. Compared with initial PS concentration and pH, dilution is easily correlated with the initial bacterial count in the suspension, and, therefore, as dilution increases, the number of bacterial cells in the suspension decreases yielding a better interaction with PS at the same concentration as compared with less dilute suspension of the bacteria. Also, the chance of encountering reactive oxygen species increases when the dilution is high, which further enhances the photo-inactivation efficiency of the bacteria. Similar results were reported in the literature but for photocatalysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> using TiO<sub>2</sub> (Benabbou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>).</p><p>The enhanced photo-inactivation efficiency with an increase in the dark incubation period is attributed to an increase in the contact time between the bacteria and the PS at prolonged dark incubation as Ergaieg and Seux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>) reported that positive charge on the photosensitizer molecule allows it to bind or in some cases penetrate into the microbial cell and the photosensitizers used in this study are cationic.</p><p>To gain further insight in the mechanism of photoinactivation ROS measurement was done which showed direct relationship between inactivation and ROS production. Evidences have been presented in the form of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl index which suggests that the ROS generated during the reaction acts on the membrane of the bacteria and alters the lipid and protein of the membrane to form reactive aldehydes and/or ketones resulting in cell damage.</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> compares the photoinactivation results obtained in this study with those reported in the literature, which clearly reveals very good potential of the dye sensitized photoinactivation method for water disinfection. However, to achieve the best results the photoinactivation process parameters need to be optimized. In addition, its efficiency against a wide range of microorganisms needs to be tested and the residual PS dye remaining in the treated water/wastewater need to be efficiently removed prior to its use/discharge.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Comparison of photo-inactivation results obtained in this study with those reported in the literature</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Organism used</th><th align="left">Photo-inactivation results</th><th align="left">References</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">

Statistical analysis of the results revealed that besides the significant individual effect due to concentration of PS, pH of bacterial suspension and dilution, interaction effect between concentration of PS and initial viable cell count was significant for the bacterial inactivation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, for providing the necessary facilities to carry out this research work.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors of this work declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Acher</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Turnheim</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Manor</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ecologically friendly wastewater disinfection techniques</article-title><source>Water Res</source><year>1997</year><volume>31</volume><fpage>1398</fpage><lpage>1404</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0043-1354(96)00000-0</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alves</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Costa</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Carvalho</surname><given-names>CMB</given-names></name><name><surname>Tome</surname><given-names>JPC</given-names></name><name><surname>Faustino</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Neves</surname><given-names>MGPMS</given-names></name><name><surname>Tome</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><name><surname>Cavaleiro</surname><given-names>JAS</given-names></name><name><surname>Cunha</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Almeida</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Charge effect on the photoinactivation of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria by cationic meso-substituted porphyrins</article-title><source>BMC Microbiol</source><year>2009</year><volume>9:70</volume><fpage>1471</fpage><lpage>2180</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Benabbou</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Derriche</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Felix</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lejeune</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Guillard</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Photocatalytic inactivation of <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> Effect of concentration of TiO<sub>2</sub> and microorganism, nature, and intensity of UV irradiation</article-title><source>Appl Catal B</source><year>2007</year><volume>76</volume><fpage>257</fpage><lpage>263</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.apcatb.2007.05.026</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Caminos</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Spesia</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Pons</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Durantini</surname><given-names>EN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mechanisms of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> photodynamic inactivation by an amphiphilic tricationic porphyrin and 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-<italic>N</italic>, <italic>N</italic>, <italic>N</italic>-trimethylammoniumphenyl) porphyrin</article-title><source>Photochem Photobiol Sci</source><year>2008</year><volume>7</volume><issue>9</issue><fpage>1071</fpage><lpage>1078</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1039/b804965c</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18754054</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR18"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Castegna A, Drake J, Pocernich C, Butterfield DA (2003) Protein carbonyl levels&#x02014;an assessment of protein oxidation.
