It is principally used in certain sweetened products such as confectionery, in personal health products such as mouthwash and toothpaste, and in the pharmaceutical industry such as a sweetener or coating agent for pharmaceutical products (Rafiqul and Mimi Sakinah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). Commercial chemical production of xylitol is based on hydrogenation of xylose in a nickel-catalysed process which is an energy and cost-demanding. Therefore, it is known that some alternative biotechnological processes have been studied, especially those involving yeasts from <italic>Candida</italic> genus (Ur-Rehman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Xylitol is an intermediate metabolite of xylose utilization by microbial strains. Numerous microbial species have a metabolic system with NADPH-dependent xylose reductase and NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase enzymes which are induced by xylose. <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic>, <italic>Candida guilliermondii</italic>, <italic>Candida athensensis</italic>, <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> and <italic>Debaryomyces hansenii</italic> are among the yeast species reported to produce high yields of xylitol (Albuquerque et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015b</xref>; Mohamad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>).</p><p>Lignocellulosic materials are widespread, abundant, renewable, cost effective and economical sources of polysaccharides which can be used for xylitol production. Residues of some agricultural and food industries contain lignocellulose as organic matter which is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and smaller amounts of pectin, protein and ashes. Hemicellulose, which is not chemically homogenous, comprises of pentoses (xylose, arabinose), hexoses (mannose, glucose, galactose), and sugar acids (Ur-Rehman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). After pretreatment with acid, alkali and/or enzymes, the carbohydrate fraction of the plant cell wall can be converted into monomeric fermentable sugars (Chandel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>). Xylose is a major sugar derived from the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, among the other sugars, such as mannose, galactose, arabinose, and rhamnose. Acid hydrolysis using diluted concentrations of acids is a very widespread treatment due to its efficiency in the process of obtaining sugars (Albuquerque et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015b</xref>). However, products that are considered toxic for microbial growth, such as phenolic compounds, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, acetic acid, and formic acid are formed (Albuquerque et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015b</xref>; Mustapa Kamal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Mateo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). Several detoxification methods have been reported to be effective in reducing the inhibitors. The most common methods employed are; neutralization and overliming, biological adaptation, extraction with organic solvent, adsorption with activated charcoal and ion-exchange resins. The effectiveness of the methods depends on the types of hemicellulosic hydrolysate and the species of microorganisms employed because different types of hydrolysate have different degrees of toxicity and each microorganism with different degrees of tolerance to inhibitors (Mustapa Kamal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate potential use of some hemicellulosic hydrolysates prepared from lignocellulosic byproducts as sources of xylose for xylitol production by indigenous yeast strains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Sixteen foodborne yeast strains were obtained from Department of Food Engineering, Hacettepe University (Ankara, Turkey) with kind supports of Professor Dr. Z.

Xylitol yield (83&#x000a0;%) of cheese-originated M2 strain was promising when compared with the results obtained by the other yeast strains in the reported studies. Mello Lourenco et al.

Various lignocellulosic residues have been reported to be used for xylitol production, some of which were corncob (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>; Kamat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>; Ramesh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>) sugarcane straw (Hern&#x000e1;ndez-P&#x000e9;rez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2016</xref>), cotton stalks (Akpinar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>), grape marc (Salgado et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>), cashew apple bagasse (Albuquerque et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015a</xref>), wheat straw (Canilha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>), wood sawdust (Rafiqul and Mimi Sakinah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>), vine trimming wastes (Rivas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>), and rice husks (Rambo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>). Chestnut shells have been used in some studies for different purposes (Aires et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>). Total amount of cellulose and hemicellulose in chestnut shell was reported to be 48.5&#x000a0;% by G&#x000f3;mez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>). It was used for the first time for xylitol production in this study. Acid hydrolysis conditions recommended were similar to those suggested by Baek and Kwon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>) which were 1.5&#x000a0;% sulfuric acid and 1:10 solid to liquid ratio. Miura et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011</xref>) also studied different hydrolyzation conditions for hydrolysis of <italic>Sasa senanensis</italic> culm and suggested the use of 2&#x000a0;% sulfuric acid and 5&#x000a0;g/g liquid to solid ratio. Biotechnological evaluation of chestnut shells would be valuable because yet there is not a useful employment of this material in industry. Turkey is one of the biggest chestnut producers in the world, leading to its various industrial applications and also high amounts of shells (Karadeniz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Xylitol production in chestnut shell hydrolysate after various pretreatments</title><p>It is known that xylitol production is affected by the remaining inhibitors in the hemicellulosic hydrolysates and sensitivity to these inhibitors could be strain specific.

</p><p>It was found that yeast growth was at low levels and xylitol production did not occur in the raw hydrolysate without any detoxification or nutrient supplementation. Activated charcoal treatment caused a little increase in xylitol production and yeast growth for both of the strains in medium H1. Addition of glucose to medium H1 enhanced cell growth but obtained xylitol concentrations were again very low. There have been contradictory reports existed for the fermentation of xylose to xylitol by yeasts when glucose was added as a cosubstrate. It was reported that although certain amounts of glucose supplementation improved overall process, higher amounts reduced xylose consumption rate and xylitol productivity. In addition, glucose is known to be utilized for cell growth faster than xylose was used, allowing NADPH regeneration by metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway (Paraj&#x000f3; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1998</xref>). Tamburini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>) reported that the addition of glucose as cosubstrate to xylose-containing medium caused an increase in biomass yield, but a delay in xylitol production; because xylose utilization took place only when the glucose had been completely metabolized.</p><p>Total nitrogen content of chestnut shell hydrolysate was very low (0.025&#x000a0;%) and fortification of the hydrolysate with a nitrogen source would be appropriate for enhancing growth and product yield. Positive effect of glucose and yeast extract addition especially on yeast growth can be seen from the results of medium H3, with a little increase in xylitol production. There are some reported studies suggesting nutrient supplementation to hemicellulosic hydrolysates, i.e. yeast extract in hardwood waste hydrolysate (Ko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>), rice bran extract in wheat straw hydrolysate (Canilha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>), urea in cashew apple bagasse hydrolysate (Albuquerque et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015a</xref>), yeast extract in corncob hydrolysate (Ramesh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>), and yeast extract and ammonium sulphate in grass hydrolysate (West <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>).</p><p>Preparation of the media H4, H5, and H6 included concentration instead of nutrient supplementation. Concentration level was one of the most important parameters in the hydrolysate treatment. It can be observed that threefold concentration for preparation of medium H4 made better effects on xylitol production other than glucose addition. Medium H4 contained 15&#x000a0;g/L xylose and gave 32.6&#x000a0;% xylitol yield. Xylitol yield decreased with increasing concentration degree in Medium H5 containing 27.5&#x000a0;g/L xylose although cell growth was better especially for the strain M2. Xylose concentration of medium H6 reached to 66.7&#x000a0;g/L, but results obtained for this medium demonstrated adverse effect of high concentration degrees, in which no growth and product formation occured. It was estimated that this was because of increased level of toxic compounds after sevenfold concentration. In addition to known inhibitory effects, Rafiqul et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>) reported that the enzyme xylose reductase was inhibited by the toxic compounds in the hemicellulosic hydrolysates. Canilha et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>) also demonstrated the negative effects of high concentration levels for wheat straw hemicellulosic hydrolysate. It was reported that three-, four- and fivefold concentrations were used and the best conditions to perform the bioconversion consisted in using a threefold concentrated hydrolysate supplemented with ammonium sulphate and rice bran extract. However, higher concentration levels could be used in different hemicellulosic hydrolysates as reported in some studies (Salgado et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>; Carvalho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Mateo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>). In this study, threefold concentration was recommended and used in the experiments including combined detoxification methods such as evaporation, overliming and activated charcoal.</p><p>Combining various detoxification methods such as evaporation, overliming, activated charcoal treatment with appropriate concentration was suggested to be the best way for xylitol production from chestnut shell hydrolysate. These methods were used in the preparation of H7, H8, and H9 which gave the highest results for xylitol production. By detoxification process used in the preparation of H7, H8, and H9, amount of total phenolic compound in the hydrolysate was considerably reduced. Total phenolic compound content decreased to 286.2&#x000a0;mg/L after overliming and pH adjustment, while it was 2150.3&#x000a0;mg/L in raw hydrolysate. It was found as 18.9&#x000a0;mg/L after activated charcoal treatment, but increased to 39.2&#x000a0;mg/L after concentration and resulted in 98&#x000a0;% reduction in total phenolics. Maximum xylitol concentrations of 6.1 and 5.8&#x000a0;g/L were obtained leading to 41 and 39&#x000a0;% product yield in the medium H7, for the strains M2 and M43, respectively. A considerable increase in xylitol production occured by the fortification of detoxified and concentrated hydrolysate with xylose and yeast extract. In the hydrolysate containing 94&#x000a0;g/L xylose (medium H9), maximum xylitol concentration was obtained as 27.7&#x000a0;g/L for <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> M2, while it was 25.3&#x000a0;g/L for <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> M43. Although obtained xylitol concentrations were low because of low xylose concentration (15&#x000a0;g/L), approximately 40&#x000a0;% xylitol yield was promising for both of the strains in the medium H7. Media H8 and H9 were used just for testing the effects of high xylose concentrations in the hydrolysate. It was found that 49&#x000a0;g/L initial xylose concentration would be more advantageous for xylitol yield, which could also be reached by high concentration levels. It is thought that xylose concentration of detoxified chestnut shell hydrolysate could be increased by increasing the concentration level more than threefold if only initial preparation (acid hydrolysis) and detoxification (activated charcoal and overliming) steps are optimized.</p><p>In conclusion, this study revealed that fortified and detoxified chestnut shell hemicellulosic hydrolysate could be evaluated as a novel fermentation medium for xylitol production by <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> M2 as well as by <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> M43. Optimization of preparation and detoxification steps was suggested to improve xylitol yield.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey for providing financial support (Project number: BAP-2011.09.01.466).
