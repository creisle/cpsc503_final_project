Two endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the leaves of <italic>G. sylvestre</italic> and identified as <italic>Polyancora globosa</italic> and <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. based on the PCR amplification and internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1-5.8S-ITS 2) sequencing of 18S rRNA gene. The process of elicitation of cell suspension cultures of <italic>G. sylvestre</italic> with dried powder of fungal mycelia (DPFM) and extracellular culture filtrate (ECF) of endophytic fungi consistently enhanced the accumulation of gymnemic acid and the DPFM was proved to be an effective elicitor when compared to the ECF. The DPFM elicited the gymnemic acid content in the range of 2.57&#x02013;10.45-fold, while the ECF elicited the gymnemic acid content in the range of 2.39&#x02013;7.8-fold. <italic>P. globosa</italic>, a novel and a rare endophytic fungal strain, has shown a great influence on the production of gymnemic acid. Cell suspension cultures elicited with DPFM of <italic>P. globosa</italic> produced higher amount of gymnemic acid content (124.23&#x000a0;mg/g dried cell weight) compared to the cultures elicited with DPFM of <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. (102.24&#x000a0;mg/g DCW). But the cultures treated with consortium of DPFM of both fungi showed great influence on the production of gymnemic acid (139.98&#x000a0;mg/g DCW) than the cultures treated with DPFM alone. Similarly, cultures treated with consortium of ECF of both fungi produced more gymnemic acid content (94.86&#x000a0;mg/g DCW) compared with cultures treated with ECF of <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp.

For this purpose, callus and cell suspension cultures are more preferred, but their yield does not match up to the growing demands. Many researchers have attempted to increase the yield of bioactive compounds through in vitro methods such as metabolic engineering, cell immobilization, optimization of nutrient medium, nutrient manipulations (Archana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>), addition of precursors and addition of elicitors (Chodisetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>; Kiran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>).</p><p>Elicitors are defined as biofactors or chemical molecules of biotic or abiotic origin which can trigger a similar response as stress induced in the plants. Elicitors can alter the physiological or metabolic activities in the plants by triggering signal transduction pathway which in turn can increase the production of secondary metabolites. Elicitors can trigger their response by inducing the gene expression pathways. Endophytic fungi are the intriguing fungal species which live inside the healthy plant tissues without causing any apparent symptoms of disease. In this symbiotic association, many benefits from the endophytic fungi have been transferred to the host plant, which includes production of natural active compounds (Kusari and Spiteller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref> ), production of growth promoters, tolerance to drought, secretion of defensive chemicals for protection against pathogens, pests and diseases, biochemical modifications in their host plant (Aly et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>; Wani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>), enhancers or elicitors of bioactive compounds through tissue culture systems including callus and cell suspension cultures (Dass and Ramawat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>; Kiran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>).</p><p>Triterpenoid saponins are a class of plant secondary metabolites synthesized via isoprene pathway by the cyclization of 2,3 oxidosqualene, an aglycone precursor to which one or more sugar moieties are added (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). Triterpenoid saponins are primarily divided into two groups, oleanane (&#x003b2;-amyrin) and dammarene type. Triterpenoid saponins possess a wide range of pharmacological activities including inhibitory activity on glucose absorption (Hideto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>), cholesterol reducing (Gurfinkel and Rao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>), anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities (Ridout et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1991</xref>; Netala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). Yields of triterpenoid saponins have been successfully enhanced in experimental systems by treating the cells and tissues with different biotic and abiotic elicitors (Veerashree et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Gymnema sylvestre</italic> R. Br. is a vine plant which belongs to Asclepiadaceae family, native to India, South Asia and Africa (Ye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>). The leaves of this plant are called Gur-mar, renowned for the treatment of diabetes in India for over 2000&#x000a0;years (Agarwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2000</xref>). The leaves also possess lipid lowering properties (Rachh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>), hepatoprotective (Jachal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>), anti-inflammatory (Malik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>), free radical scavenging (Ohmori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) and antimicrobial properties (Satdive et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>). All these activities are mainly due to the presence of triterpenoid saponins in the leaves of <italic>G. sylvestre</italic>. The total triterpenoid saponin fraction in the leaves of <italic>G. sylvestre</italic> is called as gymnemic acid (Ye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>). 18 different types of gymnemic acids (GA I to GA XVIII) were reported from the leaves of <italic>G. sylvestre</italic>. Gymnemic acid constitutes gymnemagenin as its backbone (sapogenin) with different sugar molecules attached to it (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1992</xref>). Gymnemic acids are differentiated based on the type and number of sugar molecules attached to gymnemagenin. The numerous types and complex structure of gymnemic acids make their chemical synthesis very difficult for large-scale production in industry.</p><p>Many researchers have reported the successful elicitation of plant bioactive compounds by the endophytic fungi through cell suspension cultures. The accumulation of diosgenin, a steroid, was elicited through cell suspension cultures by the endophytic fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum Dzf17</italic> isolated from <italic>Dioscorea zingiberensis</italic> (Peiqin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>). The accumulation of terpenoids, isoeuphpekinensin and euphol was elicited through cell suspension cultures of <italic>Euphorbia pekinensis</italic> by the endophytic fungus <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp E5 (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>). The production of inophyllum was elicited by endophytic fungi <italic>Nigrospora sphaerica</italic> and <italic>Phoma spp</italic> through cell suspension cultures of <italic>Calophyllum inophyllum</italic> (Kiran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>). Endophytic fungal culture filtrate was used for the elicitation of phenyheptarin production in <italic>Bidens pilosa</italic> cell cultures (Di Cosmo and Misawa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1995</xref>). The production of indole glucosinolates and camelexin was elicited using endophytic fungus <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> cell cultures (Brader et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>). <italic>Trichoderma viridae</italic> and <italic>Pythium aphanidermatum</italic> were used for the elicitation of the production of ajmalicine (Namdeo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2002</xref>) and N-acetyl-tryptamine in <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> cell cultures (Eilert et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1986</xref>). The accumulation of coumarin and its derivatives was elicited through cell cultures of <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic> by treatment with endophytic fungal elicitor (Kombrink and Hahlbrock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1986</xref>). Abiotic elicitors such as jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonate were employed for the elicitation of phenylpropanoides and centellosides in cell suspension cultures of <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> and <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, respectively (Gadzovska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>; Bonfill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>).</p><p>There were reports on the elicitation of gymnemic acid through cell suspension cultures using different elicitors including methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid (Veerashree et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>), yeast extract, chitin, pectin, culture filtrates of <italic>Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (Chodisetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>).

</p><p>Two endophytic fungi were isolated and cultured into pure isolates. Genomic DNA isolated from these two cultures was subjected to PCR for amplification of 18 S rRNA gene using ITS primers. The amplified products resulted in 518 and 541&#x000a0;bp sequences upon Sanger dideoxy nucleotide sequencing. The sequences obtained were subjected to BLASTn search for their homology and identification. The two fungal sequences were identified as <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. and <italic>Polyancora globosa</italic>. The sequences were deposited in NCBI nucleotide databases and the accession numbers were assigned as KF598857 (<italic>Xylaria</italic> sp.) and KJ638719 (<italic>P. globosa</italic>). The phylogenetic trees were constructed using NJ method with the closely related sequences retrieved from NCBI Genbank. The phylogenetic tree of <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) showed two clades. One clade showed nine fungal strains with 96% bootstrap support value, and the second clade showed five fungal strains with 67% boot strap supporting value. The phylogenetic tree of <italic>P. globosa</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) showed three clades. One clade showed three fungal strains with 99% bootstrap support value, the second clade showed thirteen fungal strains with 78% boot strap support value and the third clade showed four closely related fungal strains with 72% boot strap support value. The correct identification of endophytic fungi by phenotypic characters is a major problem, as many of them are pleomorphic and exhibit different anamorphs <italic>in planta</italic> and in vitro. Hence most of the recent studies use molecular identification through ITS sequencing of 18S rRNA gene. Further, the authentification of species identified should be carried out by comparing obtained sequences with closely related sequences. In this study, the identified fungal cultures (<italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. and <italic>P. globosa</italic>) were used as biotic elicitors in the form of DPFM and ECF.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic tree constructed using Neighbor-joining method by comparing the ITS region of 18S rRNA gene of <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp.

</p><p>The application of biotic or abiotic elicitors is an effective biotechnological approach to enhance the production of secondary metabolites in vitro. In the present study, we reported the influence of endophytic fungi (biotic elicitor) on the production of gymnemic acid in cell suspension cultures of <italic>G. sylvestre</italic>. The biotic elicitors were added to the cell suspension cultures in the form of DPFM and ECF. Elicitation of cell suspension cultures of <italic>G. sylvestre</italic> with DPFM and ECF of both endophytic fungi successfully enhanced the production of gymnemic acid. DPFM of endophytic fungi enhanced the gymnemic acid production in the ranges 2.36&#x02013;10.45-fold, while cell suspensions treated with ECF of endophytic fungi enhanced the production of gymnemic acid in the ranges 2.39&#x02013;7.8-fold.

In all the elicitation treatments with DPFM of endophytic fungi, 75&#x000a0;mg/100&#x000a0;ml was found to be an optimum elicitor concentration required to evoke the maximum response. Similarly, in all the elicitation treatments with ECF, 15&#x000a0;ml/100&#x000a0;ml was proved to be optimum elicitor concentration to evoke maximum response. In all the elicitation treatments, the maximum amount of gymnemic acid was recorded only after 72&#x000a0;h of elicitation treatment. Hence, 72&#x000a0;h was determined as the optimum incubation time required for the elicitor to evoke maximum response.</p><p>Many efforts were made for the elicitation of gymnemic acid through cell suspension cultures, using the method of through biotic or abiotic elicitation.

</p><p>In this report, we have demonstrated a strong influence of <italic>P. globosa</italic>, a very rare endophytic fungus on the accumulation of gymnemic acid and <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. was also found to be a good elicitor. The enhancement in gymnemic acid production in this study was found to be higher than gymnemic acid levels in the earlier efforts of the biotic elicitation in cell suspension cultures of <italic>G. sylvestre.</italic> Compared with the fungal elicitors from other sources, endophytic fungi from the host plant (endosymbionts) can easily adapt to the in vitro cultural conditions due to their mutualistic interactions with host, which leads to enhanced growth or high differentiation of host cells which in turn leads to the production of more secondary metabolites. The enhancement in secondary metabolite production could be also due to the presence of glycoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, growth-promoting hormones and many other fungal derived compounds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we have isolated two different endophytic fungal species <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. and <italic>P. globosa</italic> from the leaves of <italic>G. sylvestre</italic>. The isolated endophytic fungi were exogenously supplied for the elicitation of gymnemic acid production in the cell suspension cultures of leaf-derived callus of <italic>G. sylvestre. P. globosa</italic> is a very rare and novel endophytic fungus which showed very strong influence on the accumulation of gymnemic acid in the cell suspension cultures of <italic>G. sylvestre</italic>. A very-well known <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. was also proved to be a good elicitor. In this study, the form of elicitor (biomass/extracellular filtrate) that was best suited for gymnemic acid production was also reported. Culture conditions like optimum elicitor concentration and optimum incubation time were also determined for the endophytic fungal elicitors to evoke the maximum response.
