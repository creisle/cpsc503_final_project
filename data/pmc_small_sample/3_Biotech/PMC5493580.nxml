<italic>Populus davidiana</italic> is native to the Korean Peninsula and is one of the most dominant and abundantly growing forest trees in eastern Asia. Compared to other <italic>Populus</italic> species such as <italic>P. trichocarpa, P. euphratica,</italic> and <italic>P. tremula</italic>, relatively little is known about <italic>P. davidiana.</italic> Here, we performed transcriptomic analysis of <italic>P. davidiana</italic> under drought stress induced by 10% polyethylene glycol. A total of 12,403 and 12,414 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were successfully annotated with the <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> reference genome after 6 and 12&#x000a0;h of treatment, respectively. Of these, a total of 404 genes (238 up-regulated and 166 down-regulated) after 6&#x000a0;h and 359 genes (187 up-regulated and 172 down-regulated) after 12&#x000a0;h of treatment were identified as transcription factors. Transcription factors known to be key genes for drought stress response, such as AP2-EREB, WRKY, C2H2, and NAC, were identified. This results suggesting that early induction of these genes affected initiation of transcriptional regulation in response to drought stress. Quantitative real-time PCR results of selected genes showed highly significant (<italic>R</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.93) correlation with RNA-Seq data. Interestingly, the expression pattern of some transcription factors was <italic>P. davidiana</italic> specific. The sequence of <italic>P. davidiana</italic> ortholog of <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> gene POPTR_0018s10230, which plays an important role in plant response to drought, was further analyzed as our RNA-Seq results showed highly significant changes in the expression of this gene following the stress treatment. Sequence of the gene was compared to <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> gene sequence using cloning-based sequencing. Additionally, we generated a predicted 3D protein structure for the gene product. Results indicated that the amino acid sequence of <italic>P. davidiana</italic>-specific POPTR_0018s10230 is different at six different positions compared to <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>, resulting in a significantly different structure of the protein.

<italic>Populus davidiana</italic> is a plant species native to the Korean Peninsula and is one of the most widely distributed forest trees in Korea. The ubiquity of <italic>Populus</italic> species is indicative of their ability to adapt to diverse environmental conditions, such as cold (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>), salt (Gu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>), and drought (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011b</xref>; Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2013b</xref>). Drought occurs when there is insufficient irrigation or rainfall for a period, such that soil moisture is reduced to an extent that ultimately damages or injures plants. This deficiency is typically accompanied by higher evapotranspiration rates from plant surfaces compared to water absorption by the roots (Jordan and Ritchie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1971</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Drought stress has also been found to be accompanied by other abiotic stresses such as salinity and high temperature stress. Salt and drought stress signal transduction consists of ionic and osmotic homeostasis, detoxification, and growth regulation. The adverse effects of water stress on plant physiology and the mechanisms associated with water stress tolerance and water-use efficiency have been extensively studied (Osakabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>). Although <italic>Populus</italic> trees have a much deeper root system compared to agricultural corps, they are still affected by persistent drought. Persistent drought can influence the structure and growth of roots which in turn negatively affects water uptake leading to the appearance of initial drought symptoms and permanent damage if drought persists (Coder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1999</xref>; Kozlowski and Pallardy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>). Published researches on the molecular mechanisms underpinning responses to drought stress in various crops, such as maize (Avramova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>), barley (Bedada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>), potato (Gong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>), rice (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>), wheat (Okay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2014</xref>), sugarcane (Kido et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>), and soybean (Le et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>), and many other plants, including forest trees such as poplar, pine, and oak (Dong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014a</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011a</xref>). These studies provide useful information regarding the underlying mechanisms and possible management of the problem.</p><p id="Par4">
<italic>Populus</italic> is a promising model of forest trees and/or other woody plants for research on diverse stress responses (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011a</xref>; Qiu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2011</xref>; Si et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>; Yan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2012</xref>). Moderately drought-stressed <italic>Populus euphratica</italic> trees have been found to regulate stomatal closure to facilitate higher CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation and water absorption for normal growth and development. This is typically accompanied by strong transcriptional regulation of various physiological processes such as stress perception, photoreception, and oxidative stress detoxification at the molecular level (Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013a</xref>). Several studies have shown that some species of <italic>Populus</italic>, such as <italic>P. euphratica,</italic> are extremely sensitive to drought-induced cavitation (Hukin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>), whereas <italic>P. nigra</italic> shows tolerance to drought. Plant cellular responses to various biotic and/or abiotic stresses involve highly complex interconnected networks of signaling pathways, and a systematic understanding of these networks is necessary to comprehend the underlying mechanisms of stress tolerance. An efficient approach for examining the complex internal networks initiated in response to drought stress is discovering genes and metabolic pathways involved in drought stress physiology. This approach may provide clues for the production of drought-tolerant plants (Hamanishi and Campbell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Recently, high-throughput sequencing technologies have yielded accurate whole-genome sequences on a large scale at low-cost and in a relatively short time. To date, RNA-seq-mediated transcriptome analysis of three <italic>Populus</italic> species (<italic>P. tremula</italic> (Paul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>), <italic>P. euphratica</italic> (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>), and <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>) has been reported. More recently, five genes involved in the tolerance to salts, drought, waterlogging, and insect attack have been identified from a transgenic poplar line (<italic>Populus</italic>&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;<italic>euramericana</italic> &#x02018;Guariento&#x02019;) based on transcriptome analysis (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that regulate the transcription of gene expression by binding to a certain sequence of DNA or/and other protein complex, thereby altering the activity of a protein by either promoting or suppressing its function. Several studies have reported the important role of TFs in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in <italic>Populus</italic> (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2017</xref>). Examples include the NAC and WAKY TFs, as large gene families, involved in plant growth regulation, developmental processes, and stress responses. Although information on the TFs in several <italic>Populus</italic> species, including <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>) and <italic>P. euphratica</italic> (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>), has been reported, little information is available on the TFs in <italic>P. davidiana</italic>, particularly under drought stress conditions.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we present a transcriptomic analysis of <italic>P. davidiana</italic> and, in particular, the TF families induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. PEG is used for induction of high osmotic pressure, thereby causing an effect in vitro similar to drought stress (Muscolo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>). We anticipate that the findings of this study will serve as a basis for future research on drought stress physiology in <italic>Populus</italic> species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant growth and stress treatment</title><p id="Par8">

Four-week-old plants were explanted on MS [4.4&#x000a0;g MS, 3% sucrose, 0.27% Gelrite, final pH 5.8; supplemented with 0.5&#x000a0;ppm naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)].

Eight-week-old plants were used for stress treatment. Drought stresses were induced by treatment with 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG) as described by Kwon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>).

Interestingly, in a comparison of two time points (6 and 12&#x000a0;h) after drought induction, most of the genes in the WRKY, MYB, and AP2-EREBP TF families, which play major roles in the response to drought and other abiotic stresses in other <italic>Populus</italic> species (Campbell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>), were up-regulated at 6&#x000a0;h but down-regulated at 12&#x000a0;h. However, some genes in the same TF groups (WRKY, MYB, and AP2-EREBP) remained up-regulated even at 12&#x000a0;h after drought induction. Similar transcript accumulation has observed in AS2, SNF7, and Dicer-like TFs. In contrast, the C2C2-CO-like, G2-like, and TCP TFs were down-regulated at 6&#x000a0;h but up-regulated at 12&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>MapMan analysis of DEGs encoding transcription factors induced in response to drought stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG).

The results were similar to those obtained using MapMan analysis, with expression of bHLH, MYB, WRKY, C2H2 and AP2/EREBP domain-containing TFs being commonly up- and down-regulated at both time points. These major TFs accounted for almost half (45%) of all TFs from the total DEGs in response to PEG-induced drought stress.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Expression patterns of various transcription factor (TF) groups in response to osmotic stress.

The putative DNA-binding domain and C2H2 TFs comprised the major group of down-regulated transcripts at 6&#x000a0;h after PEG treatment (<bold>b</bold>); however, their expression had increased markedly after 12&#x000a0;h, along with that of C2H2, MYB, and AP2/EREBP (<bold>c</bold>). At this latter time point, the putative DNA-binding domain, bHLH, and WRKY TFs were among the down-regulated TFs (<bold>d</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2017_858_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par19">Interestingly, bHLH TFs consistently showed up- and down-regulation of transcript levels, regardless of the time point analyzed. This result indicates that bHLH TFs may be involved in multiple signal pathways in adaptation to drought, as reviewed in (Castilhos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>). A list of the most up- and down-regulated TFs at 6 and 12&#x000a0;h after drought induction are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively. In detail, the expression of a drought-responsive transcriptomic element (POPTR_0001s35280) homologous to AS2 domain-containing TFs was highest, being increased by more than 16-fold, followed by that of the PHOR1, WRKY, bHLH, AP2/EREBP, and MYB analogs. In contrast, TFs related to C2H2 TFs (POPTR_0010s13400) were down-regulated by more than 8 times, followed by transcripts related to C2C2-CO-like, ARR, bZIP, and putative DNA binding domain groups of TFs.</p><p id="Par20">After 12&#x000a0;h of stress treatment, expression of bHLH (POPTR_0015s14070) TFs was increased by more than 32-fold, followed by C2H2, C2C2(Zn)-GATA, and GARP-G2-like TFs. At the same time point, TFs related to the Trihelix (POPTR_0012s11820) group were found to be down-regulated by more than 9.5 times, followed by members of the MADS box, C2H2, AP2-EREBP, and SET-domain-containing groups of TFs. Among the small groups of TFs, Alfin (POPTR_0016s12420) and AtSR (POPTR_0010s15160) were up-regulated after both 6 and 12&#x000a0;h in response to drought stress treatment. In contrast, S1FA TFs were down-regulated at both time points. In addition, transcript accumulation of SNF7, CPP, DNA methyltransferases, E2F/DP, and silencing TFs was increased at the early time point (6&#x000a0;h), but decreased as time progressed (12&#x000a0;h). Although histone acetyltransferases (POPTR_0015s10220) and zf-HD (POPTR_0019s03790) were down-regulated at 6&#x000a0;h, they were up-regulated at 12&#x000a0;h.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">Drought stress is a major problem worldwide because of global climate change. Numerous studies have investigated the drought stress response in crop plant species, and also in a few poplar species. Diverse physiological and biological regulations are involved in the response to drought stress. Among these, TFs, which regulate the activation or deactivation of other genes involved in upstream signal transduction, are good candidates for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the drought response. The role of TFs in abiotic stress responses, including drought stress, has been established in various plant species such as rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by using molecular techniques, including microarray analysis and RNA-seq-mediated transcriptome analysis (Fowler and Thomashow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>; Nakashima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>; Rabbani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2003</xref>; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2006</xref>). However, scientific information, particularly that for TFs in the response of perennial forest trees to various abiotic stresses, including drought, is still largely lacking. In the present study, we carried out a transcriptome analysis of <italic>P. davidiana</italic> after application of 10% PEG to investigate the diverse changes in TFs mediated by drought stress.</p><p id="Par24">In order to determine the total number and types of DEGs, the transcriptomic data were subjected to quality control screening, and DEGs with a cutoff <italic>p</italic> value&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.05 were selected for further studies (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Of the total DEGs, approximately 40% were successfully mapped and annotated using the <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> reference genome data from PopGenie and Phytozome. A relatively low percentage of TFs was detected in our study compared to that detected for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice. This can be attributed to the lack of information on poplar species, for which the functions of many genes have not been predicted. In addition, the numbers of TFs among DEGs were relatively higher at 6&#x000a0;h compared to 12&#x000a0;h after PEG treatment. This indicates that plants respond rapidly to drought stress at the molecular level and initiate transcriptional regulation. Once plants detect abiotic stress, such as cold, salt, and drought, diverse of pathways are induced as a means of defense and TFs are among the key factors comprising a regulating defense system. There is a significant overlap between gene expression patterns induced by different types of stresses (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2002</xref>; Durrant et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>). TFs families, including WRKY, MYB, bHLH, AP2-AREBP, C2C2-CO-like, C2C2-Dof, and C2H2, well-known TFs that are highly related to the drought responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Saibo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2009</xref>), rice (Moumeni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2011</xref>) and soybean (Pereira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>), were most abundantly observed, and these TFs were primarily involved in drought stress response at 6&#x000a0;and 12&#x000a0;h. Among these, WRKY, MYB, and AP2-EREBP TFs, which are known to be drought-responsive TFs in other <italic>Populus</italic> species were up-regulated at 6&#x000a0;h but down-regulated at 12&#x000a0;h. However, some genes (e.g., POPTR_0013s04170) from the same TF groups remained up-regulated even at 12&#x000a0;h. In contrast, the C2C2-CO-like, G2-like, and TCP TFs were down-regulated at 6&#x000a0;h but up-regulated at 12&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These observations indicate that there is a significant crosstalk between TFs at the cellular level. For example, after 6&#x000a0;h of stress treatment, some members of the WRKY and HSF groups of TFs were up-regulated, whereas others were down-regulated. The WRKY signaling cascade is involved in both biotic and abiotic stress responses. Many studies have now established that these genes transcriptionally co-regulate responses to various types of stress. The magnitude of the role of WRKY TFs is demonstrated by the rice <italic>OsWRKY13</italic> gene, which regulates the expression of more than 500 stress-responsive genes (Qiu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2008</xref>). Overexpression of the <italic>PtoWRKY60</italic> gene in <italic>Populus tomentosa</italic> resulted in a marked increase in the expression of the defense genes <italic>PR5.1, PR5.2, PR5.5,</italic> and <italic>CPR5</italic>. Additionally, overexpression of the salicylic acid-inducible <italic>PtrWRKY73</italic> from <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> enhanced the resistance of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants to <italic>Pst</italic>DC3000.</p><p id="Par25">In addition, AP2/EREBP and bHLH TFs groups showed strong differential expression at both the time points examined in the present study. According to the Plant Transcription Factor Database (plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/), 139 loci have been identified for the AP2/EREBP family of TFs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 163 and 138 in <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (<italic>japonica</italic> and <italic>indica,</italic> respectively), 204 in <italic>Zea mays</italic>, 338 in <italic>Glycine max</italic>, and 209 in <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>. Similarly, 225 loci have been identified for the bHLH family of TFs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 548 in <italic>Glycine max</italic>, 211 and 169 for <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (<italic>japonica</italic> and <italic>indica,</italic> respectively), 388 in <italic>Zea mays</italic>, and 379 in <italic>P. trichocarpa.</italic> These data indicate that AP2/EREBP and bHLH TFs are conserved in the plant kingdom, and previous research has shown that these TFs are part of a gene regulatory network for integrating metabolic, hormonal, sugar, and redox signaling in response to abiotic stresses such as cold and drought (Dietz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>). For example, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AP2/EREBP-type TF, <italic>AtERF7</italic>, plays an important role in ABA response by interacting with protein kinase PKS3, a global regulator of ABA responses. <italic>AtERF7</italic> binds to the GCC box and acts as a repressor of gene transcription. The stomatal guard cells of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing <italic>AtEFR7</italic> show less sensitivity to ABA, and these plants have increased transpiration (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>). Furthermore, one of the bHLH family TFs in <italic>Populus</italic>, PebHLH35 from <italic>Populus euphratica,</italic> has been reported as important gene in the drought tolerance response by regulating stomatal development and photosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Dong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014b</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">
<italic>P. davidiana</italic> transcriptomic elements homologous to MYB TFs were also a major part of the genes examined in the present study. Functional characterization of <italic>P. tomentosa</italic> R2R3-MYB transcription factor <italic>PtoMYB216</italic> revealed its involvement in lignin biosynthesis. A 1.8-kb promoter sequence of this gene fused to the GUS coding sequence and introduced into <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed that GUS expression was restricted to tissues undergoing secondary cell wall formation. Overexpression of this gene enhanced the expression of lignin biosynthetic pathway genes and resulted in lignin deposition, even in cells that are normally unlignified (Tian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2013</xref>). In rice, overexpression of the <italic>OsMYB48</italic>-<italic>1</italic> transcription factor enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stress. <italic>OsMYB48</italic>-<italic>1</italic> was strongly induced by PEG, ABA, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and dehydration, whereas it was slightly induced by salinity and cold stress. Overexpression of <italic>OsMYB48</italic>-<italic>1</italic> in rice significantly increases tolerance to drought and salt stress induced by mannitol, PEG, and NaCl, and also regulates the expression of ABA biosynthesis genes (<italic>OsNCED4</italic> and <italic>OsNCED5</italic>) (Xiong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>). Collectively, the transcriptomic data generated in this study serve as a good platform for further studies investigating and incorporating biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in plants.</p><p id="Par27">TFs related to MYB, AP2-EREBP, C2H2, C2C2-CO-like, trihelix, and NAC families are good candidates for plant functional genomic studies. Among these TFs, trihelix and C2H2 TFs have been reported to be functionally involved in drought response in poplar (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>; Weng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2012</xref>). Interestingly, three genes (<italic>POPTR_0016s10460</italic>, <italic>POPTR_0016s10480</italic>, and <italic>POPTR_0018s10230</italic>) of the C2H2 TF family, reported to be drought response genes in <italic>P. trichocarpa,</italic> were detected in our transcriptome data set containing the 10 most down-regulated and 10 most up-regulated genes. As reported by (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2015</xref>), two species of <italic>Populus</italic> (<italic>P. tremula</italic> and <italic>P. tremuloides</italic>) growing in different ecological circumstance showed genetic diversity.

Comparison of the sequences of <italic>P. davidiana</italic> and <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> revealed a difference in six amino acids. Of these, the proline at position 101 was changed to serine and was associated with a significant structural alteration. Proline is known to function in maintaining structural stability and in abiotic stress response, particularly that to drought and salt stress. For example, proline accumulation was increased fourfold under osmotic stress in a resistant maize cultivar, and proline helps to stabilize subcellular structures in the control of osmolytes. Additionally, exogenous application of proline affects plant growth and photosynthesis, and improves the drought tolerance response (Hayat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref>; Jibran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>; Rai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2002</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">The results of the present study suggest that there is genetic diversity between <italic>P. davidiana</italic> and <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> and that changes in a few sequences lead to different roles of protein in response to drought stress. On the basis of this information, further biological studies using knock out/down and overexpression mutant plants of these two poplar species would provide further information on the role of this gene in response to drought stress. Taken together, the results of this study of <italic>P. davidiana</italic> TFs under drought stress will expand our knowledge of drought stress-responsive TFs, particularly with respect to how they regulate an intricate system at the cellular level, involving proteins responsible for upstream signal transduction and transcriptional regulation, and also suggest a rich resource for discovering critical genes related to the drought stress response in <italic>P. davidiana.</italic>
