This report summarizes rHuPH20 immunogenicity findings from clinical trials where rHuPH20 was co-administered with SC human immunoglobulin, trastuzumab, rituximab, or insulin. Plasma samples were obtained from evaluable subjects participating in ten different clinical trials as well as from healthy plasma donors. A bridging immunoassay and a modified hyaluronidase activity assay were used to determine rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers and neutralizing antibodies, respectively. rHuPH20-binding antibody populations from selected subjects with positive titers were affinity-purified and subjected to further characterization such as cross-reactivity with endogenous PH20. Among individual trials, the prevalence of pre-existing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies varied between 3 and 12%, excepting the primary immunodeficiency (PID) studies. Incidence of treatment-induced rHuPH20 antibodies was 2 to 18%, with the highest titers (81,920) observed in PID. No neutralizing antibodies were observed. Within most trials, the kinetics of antibody responses were comparable between pre-existing and treatment-induced antibody responses, although responses classified as persistent were more common in subjects with pre-existing titers. There was no association between antibody positivity and either local or systemic adverse events. Pre-existing and treatment-induced antibody populations were of similar immunoglobulin isotypes and cross-reacted to endogenous PH20 to similar extents. No cross-reactivity to PH20 paralogs was detected. rHuPH20 induces only modest immunogenicity which has no association with adverse events. In addition, antibodies purified from baseline-positive individuals are qualitatively similar to those purified from individuals developing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies following exposure to the enzyme.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1208/s12248-015-9782-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>anti-drug antibodies</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>rHuPH20</kwd><kwd>subcutaneous drug delivery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hyaluronan (HA) is a mega-dalton glycosaminoglycan which constitutes a component of the extracellular matrix. Due to its viscosity and high water binding capacity, the HA viscoelastic gel forms a barrier to fluid flow and molecular movement through the interstitial collagenous matrix present in the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). This places a limit on the volume and composition of fluids and drugs that can be injected into the subcutaneous (SC) space. To overcome this limitation, hyaluronidases purified from bovine or ovine testes have been employed for decades to facilitate dispersion and absorption of subcutaneously injected solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>), but their clinical use has generally been limited by impurity profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>) and issues of hypersensitivity reactions (see for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>)). More recently, the human testicular hyaluronidase (PH20, encoded by the gene SPAM1) was cloned and described as a GPI-anchored protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>) that possesses hyaluronidase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). This discovery allowed the engineering of a recombinant form of the human PH20 protein (rHuPH20) lacking the GPI anchor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>) which can be purified to homogeneity with a specific activity 50- to 100-fold greater than commercially available animal-derived hyaluronidase products.</p><p>The suitability of using rHuPH20 to facilitate dispersion of injected fluids and drugs was demonstrated preclinically in models employing rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>) as well as pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). Clinical trials with rHuPH20 have been undertaken in the areas of rapid large volume hydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>), rapid insulin and insulin analog delivery in subjects with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>), and delivery of large proteins such as immunoglobulins and monoclonal antibodies by SC rather than intravenous (IV) injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>). Importantly, the use of SC rHuPH20 in combination with various drugs has been demonstrated to generate pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles that provide advantageous or comparable (i.e., noninferior) characteristics when compared to those obtained by IV injection of drug alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>), and to increase the absorption rate of SC delivered insulin and its analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>) as well as morphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>) among others. These data demonstrate the potential of rHuPH20 to facilitate the delivery of a variety of drugs in both acute and chronic clinical settings, either enabling transition to a more convenient, patient-friendly route of administration (e.g., conversion of treatments from IV to SC) or improving the PK profile of drugs that are typically administered SC (e.g., short acting insulin products).</p><p>Even though the use of human proteins as therapeutics can be expected to reduce immunogenicity relative to non-human proteins, the potential still exists of an antibody response. In fact, clinical immunogenicity of recombinant human proteins is frequently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). The clinical relevance of those immune responses can vary widely and must be determined on a case-by-case basis through investigation of the impact of the immune response on product efficacy and safety. For example, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) may have significant impact on efficacy, through the development of neutralizing antibodies, and/or drug PK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). Cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies with an endogenous counterpart can also occur, and in some cases this has been associated with grave clinical consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). The potential impact of ADA has led to the development of regulatory guidelines for immunogenicity testing and reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, a number of cases have been reported in which pre-existing antibodies to biotherapeutics are present in a certain percentage of the population, prior to any exposure to the drug in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). The reason for these pre-existing antibodies is typically poorly understood, but their presence can complicate the interpretation of anti-drug antibody testing results obtained after administration of the drug in question.</p><p>Since rHuPH20 has been used clinically to facilitate dispersion and absorption of several co-administered biotherapeutic agents, it represents a unique opportunity to evaluate immunogenicity in multiple patient populations and dosing regimens. This report summarizes rHuPH20 immunogenicity findings from clinical trials where rHuPH20 was co-administered SC with human immunoglobulin, trastuzumab, rituximab, and insulin. In addition, a study was undertaken to determine the baseline prevalence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies in the general population. Finally, antibodies from subjects who became positive for rHuPH20-reactive antibodies following exposure to rHuPH20 were characterized along with pre-existing antibodies from subjects who had never been treated with hyaluronidase. Results suggest that rHuPH20 induces only modest immunogenicity, with no meaningful changes to adverse event profiles. In addition, antibodies purified from individuals with pre-existing positive titers have isotypes and binding characteristics to endogenous PH20 similar to those purified from individuals developing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies following exposure to the protein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical Trials</title><p>The designs of individual clinical trials for which immunogenicity analysis of rHuPH20 was conducted are described in detail in Supplemental <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.

When relevant, samples were obtained immediately prior to the next scheduled treatment of rHuPH20 in order to avoid drug interference effects. Upon centrifugation, the resulting plasma was stored at approximately &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C and transported frozen to the testing laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assays for rHuPH20-Reactive and Neutralizing Antibodies</title><p>In order to detect antibodies to rHuPH20, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassay was developed and validated according to recent regulatory guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>) and white papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). After an overnight co-incubation of plasma sample diluted 1:5 with rHuPH20 conjugated to biotin and rHuPH20 conjugated to Sulfo-TAG (250&#x000a0;ng/mL each; Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD), the resulting immune complex was captured onto streptavidin-coated plates and detected in a SECTOR 2400 instrument using ECL Read buffer (all Meso Scale Discovery). A three-tiered approach was employed consisting of screening, specificity testing using unconjugated rHuPH20 as a competitor, and two-fold step-wise titering in negative base pool plasma diluted 1:5. Statistically based cut points for screening positivity, specificity, and titration were established as recommended in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). Individual sample titers were defined as the last dilution that yielded a positive response. The positive control for this method was a rabbit anti-rHuPH20 antibody affinity-purified from a pool of serum from three rabbits immunized with rHuPH20 in Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant. In order to determine assay sensitivity, a range of positive control concentrations was spiked into human plasma and evaluated using the bridging immunoassay to determine the threshold response <italic>versus</italic> the established screening cut point. While some of the ECL responses at 50&#x000a0;pg/mL fell above the assay cut point, all of the responses at 150&#x000a0;pg/mL were demonstrated to be greater than the cut point, and hence this conservative value was chosen to represent assay sensitivity. Taken into consideration the 1:5 dilution of plasma, the sensitivity of this assay was thus determined to be &#x02264;750&#x000a0;pg/mL, a threshold that was 660-fold greater than the recommended 500&#x000a0;ng/mL for screening assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>).</p><p>In the case of the HyQvia study, primary immunodeficiency (PID) subjects were treated with pools of human IgG, which were shown to contain low levels of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies. This is a reflection of the baseline prevalence of anti-rHuPH20 in the general population described in &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>&#x0201d; section. Consequently, subjects in this study who were identified as not being able to produce mature antibodies due to their underlying immunodeficiency syndrome (X-linked agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, or hyper IgM syndrome) nonetheless presented with rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers ranging from 10 to 80, which were interpreted as the result of passive transfer of the antibodies contained in the therapeutic agent. Accordingly, HyQvia subjects were only considered to have a positive rHuPH20-reactive antibody response if a sample titer was &#x02265;160.</p><p>An assay for neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against rHuPH20 was based on the USP assay for hyaluronidase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). Briefly, plasma samples diluted 1:20 were pre-incubated with 2&#x000a0;U/mL rHuPH20 for at least an hour and was then allowed to digest high molecular weight hyaluronan for 30&#x000a0;min. Addition of acidified serum resulted in turbidity at 640&#x000a0;nm due to the presence of precipitated hyaluronan which was monitored spectrophotometrically; any neutralizing antibody in the plasma sample diminished the capability of rHuPH20 activity to lower the turbidity. The minimum required plasma dilution of 1:20 was determined based on the potential for interference by known plasma components such as inter-&#x003b1;-inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>).</p><p>For reporting immunogenicity responses, terms such as antibody prevalence, incidence, pre-existing and treatment-induced antibodies, kinetics (transient <italic>vs.</italic> persistent), and titer increase over baseline (treatment-boosting) were defined as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>). In addition, the requirement for an increase of two or more titering steps in order to consider a baseline-positive subject treatment-boosted was also defined as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>). In this case, since the titering took place in 2-fold steps, that meant that a 4-fold or higher increase in titer was required for such classification.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Adverse Events Analysis</title><p>For trial 160603/902, each reported adverse event in subjects that developed rHuPH20-reactive antibodies was graded mild, moderate, or severe, and the number of adverse events occurring prior to and following the first positive titer were added for these subjects and expressed per time unit to yield an adverse events rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>rHuPH20-Reactive Antibody Purification</title><p>For further characterization, rHuPH20-reactive antibodies were affinity-purified from 130 to 250&#x000a0;mL plasma from four HyQvia subjects who had previously yielded ECL bridging immunoassay titers in excess of 10,000 and who had titers of 2560 to 10,240 at the time of providing the sample used as a source for antibody. As controls, 700&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mL obtained by plasmapheresis of four healthy volunteers with rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers of 160&#x02013;640 was included. For affinity chromatography, Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) was conjugated with rHuPH20 and packaged into Vantage chromatography columns (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) connected to an &#x000c4;KTA Purifier instrument (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). Each plasma sample was diluted with 4&#x000a0;vol of TBS and loaded onto a fresh column, and antibodies were eluted with 0.1&#x000a0;M glycine-HCl buffer, pH&#x000a0;2.5, and immediately neutralized.

Recombinant human PH20 was also released by PI-PLC treatment from DG44-CHO cells stably transfected with a full-length cDNA construct, and affinity-purified using Sepharose 4B conjugated to a rabbit polyclonal anti-rHuPH20 antibody and otherwise as above. The concentration of human PH20 in both preparations was determined using a sandwich ECL assay using the rabbit polyclonal antibody as a capture antibody in ECL High Bind plates (Meso Scale Discovery) and a Sulfo-TAG conjugate of the same antibody as a detecting antibody. Plates were read in a SECTOR 2400 instrument and concentrations determined using four-parameter logistic regression on ECL signal obtained using a dilution series of rHuPH20 as a standard.</p><p>In order to compare the binding of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies to rHuPH20 and endogenous full-length human PH20, plasma samples confirmed positive for rHuPH20-reactive antibodies were diluted to yield an ECL signal around 5000 units (between 10- and 40-fold final dilution) and subjected to a version of the ECL bridging immunoassay described above wherein rHuPH20 conjugates were used at 100&#x000a0;ng/mL. In these experiments, increasing concentrations of unconjugated rHuPH20, sperm-derived PH20, and CHO-derived full-length PH20 were included to compete for binding to rHuPH20-reactive antibodies present in the sample.

It is typically co-infused SC along with the therapeutic, either using sequential administration or using co-formulated drug product. In either case, rHuPH20 allows the therapeutic agent to permeate more readily through the SC space and gain access to the central circulation via either the capillaries, for small molecule therapeutics, or the lymphatics, for large molecule therapeutics. This report summarizes the clinical immunogenicity responses to rHuPH20 in several clinical trials, including rHuPH20 administered in combination with insulin, therapeutic antibodies, or human IgG to a total of 1526 subjects from diverse populations. Overall, exposure to rHuPH20 was associated with emergence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies in 3 to 18% of treated individuals, depending on the trial. Of the 83 individuals who were antibody-negative prior to treatment and developed rHuPH20-binding titers after exposure to the protein, only three experienced maximum titers in excess of 10,000 using a highly sensitive bridging immunoassay. In addition, 28 subjects with pre-existing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies prior to exposure experienced treatment boosting, as defined by an increase in titer of two titering steps or more following treatment, and one of these experienced a maximum titer of 81,920, the highest titer observed following rHuPH20 exposure in this data set. Importantly, no neutralizing antibodies were identified in any of these trials.</p><p>The clinical importance of ADA responses can manifest itself in various ways: neutralizing antibodies can alter drug efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>) and, in the worst case, can cross-neutralize the endogenous counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>); both binding and neutralizing antibodies can have an impact of the PK of the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>); and circulating ADA-drug immune complexes can form with potential deleterious safety consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>). In the case of rHuPH20, no potential impact on function of endogenous PH20 should be expected since no neutralizing antibodies were observed. No clinical data are yet available regarding the potential effect of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies on PK of rHuPH20 itself; however, the action of rHuPH20 is localized to the SC space and no evidence of systemic exposure can be detected at the doses used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). This might be related to the rapid elimination of rHuPH20 from the central compartment. Even when infused IV in human volunteers, rHuPH20 has a terminal elimination half-life of only 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;min (manuscript in preparation). Finally, with regards to immune complex formation, whereas IgG can theoretically distribute to the skin and lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>), there was no difference in adverse event rates in subjects who eventually became positive for rHuPH20-binding antibodies when periods prior to and following first positive titer were compared.</p><p>A consistent finding through all the trials was the presence of rHuPH20-binding antibodies in a small percentage of subjects prior to rHuPH20 exposure. This was confirmed in a separate survey study of 961 healthy plasma donors where the prevalence of pre-existing antibodies was determined to be 6%. The basis for why they are sometimes present remains unknown but may be related to immune reactivity to endogenous PH20, a GPI-anchored hyaluronidase normally present on the apical head of male sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). Whatever their provenance, the presence of pre-existing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies does not appear to be associated with systematic titer boosting after exposure to rHuPH20 in the majority of subjects. Importantly, there were no adverse events associated with anti-rHuPH20 reactivity, with or without boosting.</p><p>The comparison of several clinical trials with unique study designs, dose levels of rHuPH20, and sampling schedules can be fraught with difficulty, which can limit the conclusions that can be drawn. In the current case, the various trials yielded similar results in terms of the nature of the rHuPH20 immunogenicity response: First, within trials, pre-existing and treatment-induced antibody titers were similar, as were their kinetics of onset of positivity <italic>versus</italic> onset of boosting as well as time to maximum titer. Second, if treatment-induced rHuPH20 antibody responses occurred, they tended to be more transient in nature than for pre-existing antibodies. The reason for this is currently unknown, but could possibly be related to the existence of a robust and long-lasting immune response to PH20 in individuals with pre-existing antibodies which predisposed towards more durable boosting. No data exists to date to address this question. Third, no neutralizing antibodies were observed in any clinical study.</p><p>The notable exception to this pattern was the response observed in the 160603/902 trial, where rHuPH20 was administered in combination with human IgG in subjects with primary immunodeficiency and induced a durable rHuPH20-binding antibody response with titers in excess of 5000 in five subjects. These titers generally diminished despite continuing treatment, and no neutralizing antibodies were ever observed; however, the nature of these responses was different from those observed in other clinical trials with rHuPH20. The reason for this could possibly be sought in the design of the trials (e.g., dosing frequency, total dose) or the co-administered therapeutic, in this case human IgG purified and pooled from plasma donors, which could contain low levels of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies due to the prevalence of such antibodies in the general population as described above. This latter notion was confirmed by analysis of preparations of human IgG which contained approximately 0.01&#x02013;0.02% of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies (unpublished observations). Besides these differences, another potential reason for the differential immunogenicity response to rHuPH20 in the 160603/902 trial was the subject population. Primary immunodeficiencies constitute a diverse group of disorders of monogenic or polygenic origin, where the genetic basis of the disorder in the more frequently diagnosed disorders such as CVID is frequently unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>). Many of these diseases predispose affected subjects to dysregulated T-cell tolerance and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>), including CVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>), which was diagnosed in three of the five cases in which the highest rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers were observed.</p><p>Beside the possibility that antibodies to rHuPH20 could attenuate <italic>in vivo</italic> enzymatic activity and produce a loss of dispersive effect at the injection site, the other theoretical concern is whether these antibodies could affect the functionality of endogenous PH20 or closely related enzymes. <italic>In vitro</italic> binding of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies to endogenous PH20 would be expected because of the high homology between rHuPH20 and PH20. On the other hand, binding of such antibodies to PH20 <italic>in vivo</italic> would be limited by the limited tissue expression profile of PH20 (adult male reproductive tract) as well as the blood-testis and blood-epididymal barriers limiting access of antibodies in systemic circulation to that milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>).</p><p>In order to address some of these concerns, treatment-induced rHuPH20-reactive antibodies as well as those from baseline-positive subjects were affinity-purified using rHuPH20-coupled resin and extensively characterized using various methods such as antibody titer, antibody isotype, and <italic>in vitro</italic> cross-reactivity to endogenous human PH20 and related hyaluronidases. The resulting antibody preparations from rHuPH20-treated and baseline-positive subjects had similar isotypes and IgG subclasses, suggesting that the degree to which immune class switching had taken place was comparable in both populations. Cross-reactivity analysis demonstrated that both types of antibody preparations bound to endogenous PH20 <italic>in vitro</italic> to a similar degree, whereas the treatment-induced antibodies bound somewhat better to rHuPH20 than did the pre-existing ones. This indicates that rHuPH20-binding antibodies emerging following treatment, even in the case of the comparably high titers occasionally observed in the 160603/902 trial, share molecular and immunological characteristics with those observed in more than 5% in the general population.</p><p>With respect to other human hyaluronidases, the risk of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies binding to them is lower because the primary structure of rHuPH20 is only distally related (i.e., 34 to 42% homology) to Hyal-1, -2, -3, and -4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>). In support of this notion, none of these plasma samples cross-reacted to recombinant Hyal-1 or Hyal-2 when using the modified bridging immunoassay. This conclusion is corroborated by results from a tissue cross-reactivity study using the affinity-purified anti-rHuPH20 antibodies to stain different human tissues (unpublished observations); the only specific immunohistochemical staining observed was in the seminiferous tubules in the testis. This expression profile differs from that observed for other hyaluronidases, which are expressed in many tissues including lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>). If anti-rHuPH20 antibodies cross-reacted with other hyaluronidase family members, multiple tissues would have been expected to be positive in the tissue cross-reactivity study. Thus, the lack of signal in multiple assay systems indicates that anti-rHuPH20 antibodies did not cross-react with PH20 paralogs.</p><p>These observations serve to alleviate potential concerns raised by the apparent binding (although not neutralization) of a treatment-induced antibody to an endogenous protein involved in aspects of reproduction and are further supported by published reports in which several attempts were made to immunize males with PH20 as an immunocontraceptive approach in animal models. These studies involved rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>), and guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>), and only the latter experienced infertility following PH20 immunization with a crude testicular extract that resulted in autoimmune orchitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>). Furthermore, sperm from mice lacking PH20 were able to fertilize eggs, albeit in a somewhat delayed manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, rHuPH20 is a recombinant human protein that appears to have modest immunogenicity and no deleterious effects on efficacy or adverse events. In addition, antibodies that bind to rHuPH20 are present in about one in 20 healthy individuals not exposed to the protein, and the functional characteristics of pre-existing and treatment-induced antibodies are similar. Therefore, rHuPH20 continues to constitute an attractive therapeutic option for delivering large molecules and fluid volumes via the SC route as an alternative to IV administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12248_2015_9782_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>Supplemental 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 26 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Drs.
