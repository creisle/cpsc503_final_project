Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) strains are foodborne infectious agents that cause a number of life-threatening diseases, including hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Shiga toxin 1 (stx1), shiga toxin 2 (stx2), or a combination of both are responsible for most clinical symptoms of these diseases. Hence, various diagnostic methods have been developed so far to detect shiga toxins such as cell culture, ELISA, Rapid Latex Agglutination (RPLA) and hybridization, but due to high costs and labor time in addition to low sensitivity, they have not received much attention. The aim of this study was to develop a complete, rapid and reliable multiplex PCR (mPCR) method by using two pairs of specific primers to detect either the stx1 or the stx2 gene confirms the presence of E.coli O157:H7. The study results show that stx1F/stx1R primers are specific for stx1 and primers stx2F/stx2R are specific for stx2 genes in E. coli O157:H7. The mPCR method with two pairs of primers for amplifying the stx1, stx2 target genes to detect E. coli O157:H7 in food has been set up successfully. Complete method performed well in both types of food matrices with a detection limit of 3 CFU/25 g or mL of food samples. Tests on 180 food samples have shown a specificity value of 93.75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 82.83–100), a sensitivity of 100 % (95 % CI, 83.79–99.85 %), and an accuracy of 96.66 % (CI 95 %, 83.41–99.91 %). Interestingly, results indicate that the mPCR performed as well as the traditional culture methods and can reduce the diagnosis time to 2 days. Finally, complete mPCR method was applied to natural samples covering a wide variety of food types proving that the mPCR method was a rapid and reliable screening method for detection of E. coli O157:H7 in food and environmental samples.



Introduction

The best-known and also most notorious E. coli bacteria that produce Shiga toxin (STEC) is E. coli O157:H7 that caused foodborne diseases, usually hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (Karmali 1989, 2004). According to recent reports by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2014) there were 11 multistate outbreaks of STEC in the United States of America during 2011–2014 with six of them attributed to E. coli O157:H7. Furthermore, E. coli O157:H7 has been recognized as a major food safety concern due to its low infectious dose. It is highly virulent, an inoculation of fewer than 10–100 CFU of E. coli O157:H7 is sufficient to cause infection (Coffey et al. 2011). E. coli O157:H7 pathogens were usually linked with a wide variety of foods such as milk, meats, meat products, dairy products and fresh products, contaminated from the field with wildlife droppings (Bell 2002; Fedio et al. 2011; Mora et al. 2007; Pennington 2010). It is also reported that E. coli O157:H7 be cross-contaminated in the preparation of meat products from intestines (Wachtel et al. 2003).

Shiga toxin (Stx) is one of the major virulence factors involved in E. coli O157:H7 pathogenesis (Melton-Celsa et al. 2012); based on immunoreactivity, toxins are classified as either Stx1 or Stx2 (Strockbine et al. 1986), which damage intestinal epithelial cells and kidneys, causing HC and HUS, respectively (Johannes and Römer 2010). The stx gene in E. coli O157:H7 is associated with a prophage (Huang et al. 1987), and different subtypes of shiga toxin are identified as stx1, stx1c, stxfc, stx2, stx2e, stx2d and stx2g (Gobius et al. 2003). Stx2 producing strains appear to be more commonly responsible for serious complications such as HUS than those only Stx1 producing (Kleanthous et al. 1990; Read et al. 1992). Infections by STEC is a major health concern even developed countries as well as developing countries all over the world. Since shiga toxins cause many diseases, especially in children and immunocompromised elderly people, a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method with prognostic information would be rather useful. Isolation of E.coli O157:H7 from foods and fecal samples usually took few days with conventional diagnostic methods [ISO 16654]. Conventional methods are laborious as they require the preparation of culture media, inoculation of plates and colony counting (Mandal et al. 2011). Furthermore, conventional methods may be limited by their low sensitivity (Lee et al. 2014). False-negative results may occur due to viable, but non-culturable pathogens. The failure to detect foodborne pathogens would increase the transmission risk of pathogens. So far, a variety of methodologies were developed to detect the presence of E. coli O157:H7; cell culture, serological, and Rapid Latex Agglutination (RPLA) have been utilized to detect shiga toxins or their respective genes. However, all these methods have their own shortcomings as they are time-consuming, quite costly and have limitations in handling many samples simultaneously. For cultivating samples in selective mediums, followed by latex agglutination or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for confirming their subtype (E. coli Pro O157). Unfortunately, the detection limit from indirect assay was at 105 cells/mL using antibodies, which was not enough to detect E. coli O157:H7 directly from food (Chart 1999). Rapid detection methods are important, particularly in food industry, as they are able to detect the presence of pathogens in raw and processed foods immediately. Rapid methods are also sensitive enough to detect pathogens that present in low numbers in the food. At present, molecular methods such as PCR are showing much promising results. In this situation, to overcome shortcomings of the aforementioned methods, mPCR is an appropriate alternative approach for detecting stx genes, improving both the sensitivity and specificity of the pathogen through amplification of its unique DNA. The mPCR is more convenient for rapid and reliable detection and quantification of pathogen-specific gene sequences.

The aim of the present work was the development of a complete multiplex PCR method for the detection of E.coli O157:H7 by using two pairs of specific primers to detect either the stx1 or the stx2 gene. Furthermore, the mPCR method is an appropriate alternative approach for detecting stx genes, able of achieving a low limit of detection, even in the presence of high numbers of competitors.
