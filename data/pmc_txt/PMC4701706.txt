
Abstract

Trichoderma isolates were obtained from diseased leaves and fruit collected from plantations in the main banana production area in Northern Queensland. Phylogenetic analyses identified the Trichoderma isolates as T. harzianum and T. virens. The Trichoderma spp. were found to be antagonistic against the banana leaf pathogens Mycosphaerella musicola, Cordana musae, and Deightoniella torulosa in vitro. Several products used by the banana industry to increase production, including molasses, Fishoil and Seasol, were tested as food source for the Trichoderma isolates. The optimal food substrate was found to be molasses at a concentration of 5 %, which when used in combination with a di-1-p-menthene spreader-sticker enhanced the survivability of Trichoderma populations under natural conditions. This formulation suppressed D. torulosa development under glasshouse conditions. Furthermore, high sensitivity was observed towards the protectant fungicide Mancozeb but Biopest oil®, a paraffinic oil, only marginally suppressed the growth of Trichoderma isolates in vitro. Thus, this protocol represents a potential to manage banana leaf pathogens as a part of an integrated disease approach.



Introduction

Loss of sensitivity and development of fungicide resistance is becoming a worldwide problem across a range of fungicides and micro organisms (Eckert et al. 1994; Holmes and Eckert 1999; Karaoglanidis et al. 2001; Sholberg and Haag 1993). Currently control of leaf fungal pathogens on bananas (Musa acuminata) in Australia is achieved with the alternation of protectant fungicides, such as Mancozeb, chlorothalonil, paraffinic oils, and systemic fungicides belonging to the strobilurin (QoI) and demethylation inhibiting fungicides (DMI), including the triazoles. The goal of such a strategy is to delay fungicide resistance. However, it has been shown that a shift in sensitivity or appearance of resistant strains occurs within 5 years of commercial introduction of a systemic fungicide (Marín et al. 2003). Such shifts have been documented for all Qo inhibitors including trifloxystrobin, azoxystrobin, famoxadone, strobilurin B and myxothiazol (Chin et al. 2001; Sierotzki et al. 2000), and the triazoles propiconazole (Romero and Sutton 1996) and tebuconazole (Grice and Peterson 2002). Extensive use of benomyl (benzimidazole) by the banana industry worldwide resulted in its withdrawal from control programs (Romero and Sutton 1998; Stover 1977; Stover et al. 1978).

Demand for environmentally safe control measures has promoted the interest in finding non-chemical alternatives, such as biological agents, for the management of fungal pathogens. Most research on biological agents to control banana leaf diseases has been done with bacteria, but with unsatisfactory results under commercial conditions (reviewed by Marín et al. 2003), as this approach requires direct contact with the fungal phytopathogens. Jiménez et al. evaluated 225 epiphytic populations but with little success as these microorganisms experience difficulties in surviving on the phylloplane. A commercial strain of Bacillus subtilis (in Marín et al. 2003), Serratia marcescens isolates (Miranda 1996), and chitinolytic bacteria (González et al. 1996) evaluated under field conditions did not provide an effective control of banana leaf diseases.

Best results to improve biocontrol of a broad range of phytopathogenic fungi have been achieved with various strains of Trichoderma species (reviewed by Benítez et al. 2004). Schilly et al. explored 360 bacterial and 143 fungal banana root-associated endophytic microorganisms and found that T. asperellum significantly inhibited the growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, the casual agent of Fusarium wilt of banana, a devastating problem for the banana industry worldwide. Genus Trichoderma possesses antagonistic properties, which are based on the activation of multiple mechanisms, acting synergistically. They affect fungal pathogens either directly by mycoparasitism, or indirectly by competing for nutrients and space, changing the microenvironment, inducing localised or systemic plant defences, acting like plant hormones, boosting plant rooting, and helping improve nutrient uptake (biofertilisation) resulting in increase plant growth (Benítez et al. 2004; Harman et al. 2004). Furthermore, Trichoderma spp. have been found to be highly resistant to a variety of chemical fungicides, toxins and xenobiotic compounds including antibiotics (Harman et al. 1996). Thus they might represent an opportunity to control banana leaf pathogens under commercial conditions.

Most studies have focused on biological agents as alternatives to synthetic fungicides and not as part of an integrated management system (Jacobsen et al. 2004). However, from the research done on biological control of leaf spot diseases (reviewed by Marín et al. 2003), it is evident that application of biological agents might not be sufficient for a successful disease management alone but instead biological agents have to be a part of an integrated management program (Elad et al. 1995; Harman 2000). The combination of biological agents with reduced levels of fungicides promotes a degree of disease suppression similar to that achieved with full fungicide treatment (Elad et al. 1993a, b; Monte 2001) and minimises development of fungicide resistance. Furthermore, locally occurring isolates will normally be more effective than isolates collected from different environment due to environmental adaptation. The aims of this study were to identify Trichoderma strains that survive on leaves of Musa acuminata under wet tropical conditions, to investigate their antagonistic potential against banana leaf fungal pathogens in vivo and in vitro, to develop a strategy that will support the colonisation of banana leaves by Trichoderma populations under natural conditions, and to explore the suitability of incorporating Trichoderma spp. as a biological agent in an integrated management program.
