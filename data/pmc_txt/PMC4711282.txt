All N2 fixers carry a nifH gene, which encodes the Fe protein of the nitrogenase. The nifH database has lots of uses like phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses, the design and assessment of primers/probes, and the evaluation of nitrogenase gene diversity (Gaby and Buckley 2014); hence, making nifH an ideal phylogenetic gene marker for investigation of potential nitrogen-fixing organisms in natural environments (Chowdhury et al. 2009). In addition, the phylogeny based on nifH genes has been shown largely to resemble the 16S rRNA phylogeny (Raymond et al. 2004). This nifH gene has been largely studied by culture-independent approaches. Studies have provided a rapidly expanding database of nifH sequences and revealed a wide diversity of unculturable diazotrophs (Tan et al. 2003). These approaches provide a more complete picture of the diazotrophic community than culture-based approaches.

Further, unculturable microbial diversity could be a great resource to dig out the new ideas for sustainable agricultural practices and biotechnological applications. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to analyze the unculturable nitrogen-fixing bacterial community of the cold adapted soil. The study area is located in north India (Uttarakhand) which comes under western Himalayan region. The nifH gene was amplified from metagenomic DNA of soil collected from different regions of Uttarakhand (India).
