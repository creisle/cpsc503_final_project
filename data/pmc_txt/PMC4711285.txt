
Abstract

A biomolecule namely pyocyanin was isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BTRY1). It was confirmed by UV–Vis spectrum with absorption maxima at 270 nm and was further characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Spectroscopy analyses showed the presence of relevant bonds in their respective structures. Although pyocyanin had antihemolytic, antioxidant and antibiofilm activities against food pathogens, it showed no observable cytotoxicity, and thus proposed for potential use in the preservation of food.



Introduction

Pseudomonas aeruginosa are Gram-negative, aerobic rod-shaped bacteria, motile by single polar flagellum (Moore et al. 2006); attracting attention due to the different pigments it produces like pyocyanin (blue-green), pyoverdin (yellow, green and fluorescent), pyomelanin (light-brown) and pyorubrin (red-brown) (Meyer 2000). Nearly 90–95 % of P. aeruginosa isolates produce pyocyanin, normally referred to as ‘‘blue pus’’ (from pyocyaneus) (Ran et al. 2003). The present study focuses on the extraction, characterization and study of the bioactive properties of the bioactive compound, pyocyanin, isolated from the strain P. aeruginosa BTRY1.
