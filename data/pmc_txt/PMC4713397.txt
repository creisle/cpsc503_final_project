Large-scale expression of biopharmaceutical proteins in cellular hosts results in production of large insoluble mass aggregates. In order to generate functional product, these aggregates require further processing through refolding with denaturant, a process in itself that can result in aggregation. Using a model folding protein, cytochrome C, we show how an increase in final denaturant concentration decreases the propensity of the protein to aggregate during refolding. Using polarised fluorescence anisotropy, we show how reduced levels of aggregation can be achieved by increasing the period of time the protein remains flexible during refolding, mediated through dilution ratios. This highlights the relationship between the flexibility of a protein and its propensity to aggregate. We attribute this behaviour to the preferential urea-residue interaction, over self-association between molecules.



Introduction

Biopharmaceutical production of therapeutic proteins including hormones and monoclonal antibodies (Shukla and Thömmes 2010) is a rapidly expanding area of research in biotechnology. However, the full benefits of this technology are yet to be fully realised as there are a number of barriers present in commercial production. One of these barriers is that of protein aggregation, where non-native protein monomers self-associate to form non-functional macromolecules; aggregates. The presence of these aggregates represents a loss of yield (and the cost of further processing in removing them), and their presence in therapeutics can trigger an immunogenic response, rendering the treatment ineffective (Sauerborn et al. 2010). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of aggregation and development of protocols for reduction of aggregation are of high importance.

Post cellular production, quantities of the therapeutic protein take the form of inclusion bodies; a high concentration, insoluble mass aggregate of the recombinant protein that requires purification through refolding to obtain functional protein. High concentrations of denaturant (commonly urea) are required to solubilise the inclusion bodies and unfold the high-molecular weight aggregates (Basu et al. 2011). The preferential interaction (over that of water) amongst urea, the protein backbone and side chain groups are responsible for the unfolding of the aggregate at high denaturant concentrations (Canchi and García 2011; Guinn et al. 2011). These interactions drive the equilibrium of the protein towards the unfolded state with increasing concentration of denaturant (Canchi et al. 2010). Whilst in the presence of 8 M urea, it is possible that a protein still maintains some semblance of its native structure, forming a conformational space template for the protein to fold as limited hydrophobic interactions may still remain (Shortle and Ackerman 2001). Removal of the concentrated denaturant drives the collapse of the protein via hydrophobic and conformational backbone interactions (Haran 2012), wherein the protein folds to a low energy state. Whilst hydrophobic collapse drives the formation of the native state, the exposure of hydrophobic residues can lead to aggregation of protein monomers in high concentration environments (Fink 1998). Rapid refold dilution is common practice to instigate hydrophobic collapse and prevent hydrophobic exposure, however, Boismenu et al. showed that a slow refold dilution is capable of increasing refold yield significantly. Due to the time dependent nature of the effect, we postulate this may be attributed to mediation of late folding processes involved in residue rearrangement and structural mobility; the molten globule state, which occurs over a timescale of seconds (Arai and Kuwajima 1996).

Using multiple stopped flow techniques, it is possible to probe protein flexibility and investigate the role of final denaturant concentration in refolding in terms of aggregation. Fluorescence anisotropy is an analytical technique which offers the opportunity to probe the rotational mobility of fluorophores within the protein molecule, and provide information on their packing (Otto et al. 1994). It has previously been used to probe the mobility of chaperone complexes (Weissman et al. 1996), whilst experiments into refolding have clearly shown the existence of a molten state during refolding (Canet et al. 2001) but its use in relating this mobility to aggregation is novel. We combine this with stopped flow absorbance measurements to monitor aggregation during refolding. Here we present data for cytochrome C, a protein which contains no disulphide bonds, as a model system for biopharmaceuticals and show that the existence of its molten globule during folding is directly linked to its aggregation.
