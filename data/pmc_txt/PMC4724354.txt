
Abstract

Acne vulgaris (acne) is a chronic inflammatory disease prevalent among adolescents and adults, with significant psychological effects. The aetiology of acne is multifactorial. Several pathophysiological associations have been identified in which Propionibacterium acnes plays a major role. This bacteria primarily affects areas containing oil glands including the face, back and trunk, where it causes the formation of seborrhoea and inflammatory lesions. The treatment methods currently in place have side effects. A novel alternative method with no side effects is hence required. In this study, we report the synthesis of an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacterial-based nanoparticle as a stable biocompatible material for drug delivery. We then evaluated the effectiveness of EPS-based nanoparticle cream against P. acnes. Our results demonstrate that EPS nanoparticles have great potential as a safe and effective topical treatment for acne vulgaris and other associated infections.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris (acne) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sebaceous gland characterized by follicular hyperkeratinization and excessive colonization by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) (Beylot et al. 2014). Acne affects the majority of adolescents, who develop inflammatory lesions such as papules, pustules and nodules, as well as other non-inflammatory lesions (Webster 2014). P. acnes activates immune reactions by releasing chemo-active agents that attract neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kistowska et al. 2015). Despite the availability of a number of antibiotics, antibiotic resistant strains of acne are a cause of major global concern (Lomholt and Kilian 2014). In consequence, there have been increased attempts to find a naturally occurring anti-acne agent (Tin and Wiwanitkit 2014). Over the past few decades, exopolysaccharides have gained attention for their bioactive properties such as stability, biodegradability and biocompatibility. In general, exopolysaccharides (EPS) are usually anionic heteropolysaccharides due to the presence of various constituents such as xanthan, alginate and glycans, etc. EPS produced by microorganisms vary in their composition and properties such as anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, anti-tumoral, anti-ulcer, anti-immune stimulation along with cholesterol-lowering ability (Kumar et al. 2007; Raveendran et al. 2013; Raposo et al. 2014). The mechanism of EPS owing to the antimicrobial activity is attributed to its low degree of polymerization and degree of deacetylation (Poli et al. 2011). EPS penetrates into the cell membrane of the bacteria which in turn interrupts the replication process of bacteria there by suppressing microbial growth (Nwodo et al. 2012). In this study, we synthesized an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacterial-based nanoparticle serving as a stable biocompatible material for drug delivery. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the EPS-based nanoparticle creamâ€™s antimicrobial activity against P. acnes.
