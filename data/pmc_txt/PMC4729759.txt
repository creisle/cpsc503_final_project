
Abstract

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem-cell disorder which proliferates due to abnormal growth of basophil cells. Several proangiogenic molecules have been reported to be associated in CML progression, including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). However, detail mechanism about the cellular distribution and function of HGF in CML is yet to be revealed. The proliferation of hematopoietic cells are regulated by some of the growth factors like interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-6, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, etc. In this study IL-6 pathways have been taken into consideration which induces JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways to decipher the CML progression stages. An attempt has been made to model these pathways with the help of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and estimating unknown parameters through fminsearch optimization algorithm. Some of the specific component like STAT3, of the pathway has been analyzed in detail and their role in CML progression has been elucidated. The roles of STAT3 inhibitors into the treatment of CML have been thoroughly studied and optimum concentration of the inhibitors have been predicted.
