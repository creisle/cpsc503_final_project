Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the primary etiological agent responsible for cervical cancer in women. Although in total 16 high-risk HPV strains have been identified so far. Currently available commercial vaccines are designed by targeting mainly HPV16 and HPV18 viral strains as these are the most common strains associated with cervical cancer. Because of the high level of antigenic specificity of HPV capsid antigens, the currently available vaccines are not suitable to provide cross-protection from all other high-risk HPV strains. Due to increasing reports of cervical cancer cases from other HPV high-risk strains other than HPV16 and 18, it is crucial to design vaccine that generate reasonable CD8+ T-cell responses for possibly all the high-risk strains. With this aim, we have developed a computational workflow to identify conserved cross-clade CD8+ T-cell HPV vaccine candidates by considering E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from all the high-risk HPV strains. We have identified a set of 14 immunogenic conserved peptide fragments that are supposed to provide protection against infection from any of the high-risk HPV strains across globe.

Introduction

Cervical cancer is the second most common malignant cancer in terms of incidence and mortality rates in women worldwide after breast cancer (Pisani et al. 1993; Collins et al. 2006; Jemal et al. 2011; Senapathy et al. 2011; Torre et al. 2015). Human papilloma virus (HPV) is considered as the major etiological agent for cervical cancer which is responsible for over 265,700 total women deaths per year with around 527,600 new cases every year (Torre et al. 2015). It is estimated that about 80 % of women could acquire a HPV infection in their lifetime (Baseman and Koutsky 2005). On an average, every woman who dies due to cervical cancer loses about 26 years of life which is considerably greater than the average years of life lost to breast cancer (19.2 years) (Herzog and Wright 2007; Pandhi and Sonthalia 2011). Till now over 200 types of HPV strains have been sequenced (Bernard et al. 2010; Meiring et al. 2012; McLaughlin-Drubin 2015; Supindham et al. 2015), among them 16 are known to be high-risk virus strains (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 69, 73, and 82) (Muñoz et al. 2003; Markowitz et al. 2007; Sumalee et al. 2008; Meijer et al. 2009; Dames et al. 2014) with oncogenic HPV DNAs detected in 99 % of the cervical cancers (Dunne et al. 2007). High-risk HPV strains are in most of the cases identified as main etiological agents in cervical, anal, and other genital cancers, among them about 70 % of cervical cancers worldwide are only due to HPV strains 16 and 18 (Dunne et al. 2007). For the primary prevention of cervical cancer, HPV vaccines are widely used as an important added tool (Ault et al. 2004; Fife et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2012). Prophylactic and the therapeutic formulation are the two strategies for cervical cancer vaccine candidates. Recently, FDA approved a vaccine named ‘Gardasil 9’ that protects females between the ages of 9–26 against nine HPV strains. More specifically, the first generation of Gardasil vaccine was capable to provide protections against four HPV strains (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18) while the latest approved version of Gardasil vaccine (Gardasil 9) provides protection against five additional high-risk HPV strains (HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, and HPV-58) responsible for almost 20 % of cervical cancers worldwide (Braaten and Laufer 2008; Petrosky et al. 2015). Gardasil and Cervarix are prophylactic vaccines and offer no therapeutic benefit for persons already infected with HPV (Wain 2010; Pandhi and Sonthalia 2011). Most of the vaccine candidates that can be used as therapeutic vaccines include immunogenic fragments from early proteins (targets for cellular immunity) for the resolution of precancerous lesions and cervical cancer (Huh and Roden 2008). The protection offered by current vaccines is primarily against HPV types (16 and 18), although cross-protection for other high-risk HPV strains cannot be neglected. The identification of highly conserved cross-clade epitopes suitable for therapeutic intervention is clearly a crucial prerequisite for epitope-based vaccines development and for diagnostic tests to distinguish infection from high or low risk HPV strains. Cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) cross-reactivity is alleged to play an essential role in generating immune responses (Frankild et al. 2008; Petrova et al. 2012). HPV-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes immune responses can be detected in all untreated cervical cancer patients (Eiben et al. 2002; Valdespino et al. 2005). In animal models, cell-mediated immunity is considered to be an important mechanism for abolition of subclinical or neoplasic virus-infected cells, particularly CTL which lyses tumor cells in an antigen-specific manner (Chen et al. 1991; Feltkamp et al. 1993; De Bruijn et al. 1998; Torres-Poveda et al. 2014). Instead of individual epitopes, the use of the full-length protein with a great amount of immunogenic peptides may have a better chance to induce specific CTLs, as shown previously (Strobel et al. 2000; Adams et al. 2003; Bet et al. 2015) but the protection from all high-risk HPV strains from single vaccination will still be a question. Selection of immunogenic consensus conserved epitopes from the proteins of all HPV high-risk strains may provide an experimental basis for designing of universal HPV T-cell vaccines. In the present work, we identified conserved consensus immunogenic CD8+ T-cell epitopes from the proteome of all high-risk HPV strains and proposed a peptide pool with the ability to show immunogenic responses against all the known high-risk HPV strains.



Discussion

In the post-genomic era, strategies of vaccine development have progressed dramatically from traditional Pasteur’s principles of isolating, inactivating and injecting the causative agent of an infectious disease, to reverse vaccinology that initiates from in silico analysis of the genome information (Akhoon et al. 2011). In silico works have attracted considerable attention of experimental biologists for rapid screening and identification of probable vaccine candidates (Sakib et al. 2014; Sharma et al. 2013; Hasan et al. 2013; Oany et al. 2014). The availability of fully sequenced proteome from high-risk HPV strains provide an opportunity for computer-aided screening of reliable peptide-based therapeutic vaccines candidates among billions of possible immune-active peptides.

We extracted high-risk HPV proteome for 8 HPV specific proteins designated as E- (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6 and E7) or L-type (L1 and L2) according to their expression in early or late differentiation stage of the epithelium (Burd 2003; Rautava and Syrjänen 2012). The early secretary proteins expressed during early differentiating stage of epithelium development in all the 16 high-risk HPV strains. Since the E5 protein of HPV has previously been reported as inducer of down-regulation of MHC class I, we ignored E5 protein in the current analysis. Moreover, E2–E5 region has been shown to be lost when the episomal HPV DNA integrates into host chromosome; using E2–E5 proteins as vaccine candidates may be futile. However, since E1 and E2 are expressed in higher levels than E6 and E7 early in the progress of an HPV infection, it may be assumed that these proteins may considered as good targets for vaccine designing to treat early stages of disease (Burd 2003). Therefore, E2 protein was included for epitope-based vaccine designing in the present study along with E1, E6 and E7 protein. Based on our computational workflow, we generated a pool of 14 peptide fragments with length varying from 9 to 43 amino acid residues to provide immunogenic responses against all the high-risk HPV strains. The hallmark of the immune system is its ability to recognize and distinguish between self and non-self. T-cells do this task by recognizing peptides that are bound to MHC receptors. Epitopes are usually thought to be derived from non-self protein antigen that interacts with antibodies or T-cell receptors, thereby activating an immune response. Epitopes are usually thought to be derived from non-self protein antigen that interacts with antibodies or T-cell receptors, thereby activating an immune response. Also the antigen–antibody interaction is reversible, therefore, weak interactions often lead to cross-reactivity of antigens. The main reasons of cross-reactivity are either the homologous proteins that are conserved throughout the development and expressed by both the infectious agent and the host or the viral proteins that share short regions of amino acid sequence similarity with a non-homologous host protein. Therefore, to exclude the epitopes those are conserved between the pathogen and the host, we performed sequence alignment of the selected pool of 14 immunogenic peptides with entire human proteome. We did not observe similarity between any of the selected immunogenic peptide fragments with human proteome, we also discarded epitopes showing weak interactions with HLA alleles. Thus we believe that all the 14 sequences together will form the best peptide pool to generated immunogenic responses against any of the high-risk HPV strains infection.

Population coverage analysis for a given set of immunogenic peptides is important to determine their efficacy as the frequency of expression of their targeted HLA alleles varies across ethnicities. With the population coverage analysis, we concluded that least immunogenic response is shown by HPV strain 73 followed by strain 56 in almost all the ethnicities. Thus, the data indicate that the generated peptide fragments pool will provide very weak protection against HPV Type 73 and 56. The best response is shown by North American population for all the HPV high-risk strains based on the HLA alleles frequency data. Overall, we proposed the pool of 14 immunogenic peptide fragments with length ranging from 9 to 43 amino acid residues to provide the protection against all the HPV high-risk strains except Type 73 and 56 in all the ethnicities.
