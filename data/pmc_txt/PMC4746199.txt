
Abstract

Pectinases are the growing enzymes of biotechnological sector, showing gradual increase in their market. They hold a leading position among the commercially produced industrial enzymes. These enzymes are ecofriendly tool of nature that are being used extensively in various industries like wine industry; food industry; paper industry for bleaching of pulp and waste paper recycling; in the processing of fruit–vegetables, tea–coffee, animal feed; extraction of vegetable oil and scouring of plant fibres. Moreover, enzymatic catalysis is preferred over other chemical methods, since it is more specific, less aggressive and saves energy. This is the review which covers the information available on the applicability potential of this group of enzymes in various sectors.
