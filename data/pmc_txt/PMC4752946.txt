
Abstract

Polythene and plastic waste are found to accumulate in the environment, posing a major ecological threat. They are found to be considered non-degradable, once it enters the environment it has been found to remain there indefinitely. However, significant attention has been placed on biodegradable polymer, identification of microbes with degradative potential on plastic material. The aim of the present investigation was to biodegrade low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using potential fungi isolated from landfill soil. Based on 18S rRNA analyses the isolated strain was identified as Aspergillus clavatus. LDPE degradation by A. clavatus was monitored for 90 days of incubation in aqueous medium. The degradation was confirmed by changes in polyethylene weight, CO2 evolution by Strum test, infrared spectra and morphological changes by SEM and AFM analysis.



Introduction

During the past decade polyethylene materials have gained widespread use in various fields and have become indispensables. They offer a number of advantages over other materials being versatile, light weight, low cost, strong and potentially transparent and are ideally suited for a variety of applications. However, plastic materials have several disadvantages, the most important criterion is its long-term persistence in the environment and their resistance to degradation. A general estimate of worldwide plastic waste generation is about 57 million tons (Kumar et al. 2007). Polyethylene is the one of the most abundant commercially produced synthetic polymers. LDPE accounts for 60 % of the total plastics production of plastic bags and most commonly found solid waste. Polyethylene is very resistant to biodegradation due to its high hydrophobicity and its long carbon chains (Contat-Rodrigo and Ribes Greus 2002). Under normal condition, it takes more than 10 decades to mineralize the polymers (Ohtake et al. 1998). Several cities in Brazil have prohibited the distribution of plastic bags by supermarkets and other commercial establishments because they are made of various chemicals which are toxic to the health and the environment. An estimated one million birds and ten thousands marine animals die each year as a result of ingestion of plastics (Palmisano and Pettigrew 1992). Intensive research is being carried by scientist in the development of degradable plastics to enhance biodegradability of plastic products in landfills and composts. Degradable plastic is a plastic designed to undergo significant changes in its chemical structure under specific environmental conditions resulting in loss of some of its properties (Albertsson et al. 1987). Polymeric characteristics such as molecular weight, crystallinity, functional groups, mobility, substituent present in the structure and the additives added to the polymers play a significant role in its degradation (Gu et al. 2000). The fate of these organic polymers in the environment and the time required for their total mineralization to CO2 have yet to be fully understood. To relieve the abnormal circulation, there are two ways, one is to develop the latent ability of microorganisms to degrade plastics presently used and the other is to develop synthetic polymers susceptible to degradation (Hiroyuki et al. 1978). Low-density polyethylene can be degraded in various methods as follows: chemical degradation, photodegradation and biological degradation (Da Luz et al. 2014). The microbial species associated with the degrading polymers were identified as bacteria (Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus), fungus (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus glaucus and Trichoderma) (Swift 1997). There are many researchers around the globe investigating the ability of enzymes released by microbes in oxidizing the hydrocarbon of polymer. Microbial enzymes induce the rate of biodegradation of LDPE very effectively without causing harm to the environment. The extracellular enzymes are too large to penetrate deeply into the polymer material, and so, act only on the polymer surface, consequently the biodegradation of plastics is usually a surface erosion process. The UV irradiation (photo-oxidation) and thermal and chemical oxidation of polyethylene prior to its exposure to a biotic environment enhances biodegradation.

The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the biodegradation of LDPE films by exposing them to the isolated fungal strain. Fungus was chosen as they are highly diverse and they play a major role in decomposition of lignocellulose polymer and posses wider metabolic capabilities. The morphological changes of LDPE were analyzed after degradation through AFM and SEM.
