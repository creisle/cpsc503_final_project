Curcuma longa L. commonly known as turmeric is a rhizotomous herb of family Zingiberaceae cultivated in Indian sub-continent and the Middle East countries. The mature dried rhizome is most common ingredient of Indian kitchen as spice and well known antiseptic, antipyretic since ancient times. The medicinal properties are assigned due to the presence of curcuminoid and sesquiterpenoid compounds. Curcumin, the most important curcuminoid, is used as antioxidant, antimicrobial anti-inflammatory andis even effective against cancer and HIV (Srimal 1997; Aggarwal et al. 2007; Aggarwal and Sung 2009). Plants interact with diverse communities of microorganisms for various purposes including growth promotion, yield enhancement and disease management. In turn, the microbes derive shelter and nutrients from the host plants (Reiter and Sessitsch 2006). Rhizosphere is the most prominent zone for the microbial interaction, while some of the bacterial species enter inside the plant tissue and resides as endophytes without causing any symptoms. During endophytic colonization the microbe resides in almost every internal part of plant ranging from tissues of the underground roots to stem, leaf, flower, fruit and seed (Hallmann et al. 1997a, b). The endophyte population varies depending upon the tissue, plant developmental stage and the surrounding environment such as season as reported in soybean (Kuklinsky-Sobral et al. 2004). Endophytes actively or passively trigger the physiological changes in the plant cell (Conrath et al. 2006). They are superior in growth promotion over the rhizobacteria owing to better adaptations against abiotic or biotic stresses (Pillay and Nowak 1997). Bacterial endophytes promote host plant growth through direct mechanisms by producing phytohormones IAA, gibberellins, cytokinins (Lee et al. 2004), phosphate solubilization (Wakelin 2004), N2 fixation (Compant et al. 2005) or indirectly by production of antibiotics (Ezra et al. 2004), siderophores (Lodewyckx et al. 2002) and lytic enzymes against the pathogens (Chernin and Chet 2002). Many endophytes constitute the common soil bacteria (Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and Bacillus) that produce diverse range of secondary metabolites, antibiotics and volatile organics to counters the deleterious effects of pathogens by mechanisms in line with the PGPR (Kloepper et al. 1999; Lodewyckx et al. 2002). In addition, endophytes also counteract the adverse effects of salinity for sustainable agriculture.

The underground turmeric rhizome favors growth of various microbial communities or endophyte, which modulates plant growth through the synthesis of biochemicals and secondary metabolites. The present study was undertaken to study the endophytic bacterial community of the turmeric rhizome and their response to the salinity stress, antimicrobial agents and substrate utilization pattern.



Discussion

The turmeric rhizome was rich in endophytic bacterial diversity. In the turmeric, isolated endophytic bacterial isolates belonged to six different species B. cereus (ECL1), B. thuriengenesis (ECL2), Bacillus sp. ECL3, B. pumilus (ECL4), P. putida (ECL5) and C. michiganensis (ECL6). These strains previously reported as endophytes in different plant species like Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. in tomato and rhizomes of ginger (Rashid et al. 2012; Jasim et al. 2013). B. cereus isolated from Chenopodium majus (Goryluk et al. 2009), P. putida in Zingiber officinale (Jasim et al. 2013) and Poulus tree (Taghavi et al. 2009). C. michiganensis strain reported as a pathogen which cause cankar of tomato and goss wilt of corns but it is also reported as non-pathogenic in the Prairie plants (Zinniel et al. 2002). Pathogenesis is a multi-factorial process which depends on the immune status of the host, ability to invade host tissue and plants exudates. Turmeric endophytic isolates C. michiganensis (ECL6) was non-pathogenic in nature, this may be due to the properties of biochemical constituents curcuminoids and sesquiterpenoids present in the plant which have antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant properties. In the previous study of Ding et al. also used Calvibacter sp. as inoculants in Chorispora bungeana for chilling tolerance. During the plant growth promotion trait analysis, all the endophytic strains produced significant amount of IAA, which has already been reported in B. cereus (Rana et al. 2011) and P. putida (Jasim et al. 2013). The extent of production was found maximum in case of P. putida (ECL5) and minimum in C. michiganensis (ECL6) in the presence of tryptophan. IAA is the most common plant hormone, which stimulate the growth and reproduction of plants (Taghavi et al. 2009). IAA produced by bacteria interacts with the plants in diverse ways from pathogenesis to phytostimulation. IAA is the main auxin in the plants which involved in cell enlargement and division, tissue differentiation, physiological processes (Woodward and Bartel 2005; Spaepen et al. 2007). The amount of IAA produced by bacteria play important role in plant–microbe interaction (Xie et al. 1996). The modulation of plant growths takes place by optimal IAA concentration range. In the study of Persello-Cartieaux et al. it is found that inoculation of IAA producing bacteria Pseudomonas thivervalensis at the amount 105 CFU ml−1 in Arabidopsis resulting reproducible morphological changes but the amount of 106 CFU ml−1 inoculants inhibit the plant growth.

Siderophore production by the bacterial strain is one of the biocontrol mechanism. The iron-chelation by bacteria makes them better competitors for the available iron and in this way, prevents growth of the pathogenic microorganisms. In this study siderophore production was observed only in two strains Bacillus sp. (ECL3) and P. putida (ECL5), similar to the previous report by Jasim et al.. Plant growth promoting bacteria solubilize insoluble phosphates to make them available to enhance crop productivity. Four endophytic strains B. cereus (ECL1), Bacillus sp. (ECL3), B. pumilus (ECL4) and P. putida (ECL5) solubilized phosphate which strengthen the results as reported previously in Bacillus sp. and P. putida (Pandey et al. 2006; Forchetti et al. 2007).

The endophytic bacterial isolates reside and multiply in the plants where the environment contains relatively high ionic strength which successively tolerated both the biotic and abiotic factors. Previously many authors reported the endophytic strain which successively tolerated the high salt concentration (Hallmann et al. 1997a, b; Lopez et al. 2011; Rashid et al. 2012; Singh et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2015). In this study the endophytic isolates were able to grown differentially at different salt levels. In a previous study, Pseudomonas sp. tolerated up to 4 % NaCl, while Bacillus sp. 2 % NaCl (Rashid et al. 2012). The endophytic bacterial strains of Momordica charentia showed tolerance to 4–10 % NaCl (Singh et al. 2013).

Many endophytic bacterial strains exhibited antibiotic properties that inhibit the growth of an antagonistic bacterium. Amongst all bacterial strains were sensitive to Chloramphenicol and Erythromycin but the strain B. thuriengenesis (ECL2), B. pumilus (ECL4) resistant to polymixine-B and rifampicin respectively. The antibiotic disc acts differentially on the growth of same bacterial strains of different isolation source. In case of Cassia tora bacterial isolate Pseudomonas sp. resistant to chloramphenicol and amoxicillin (Kumar et al. 2015) in contrast to Pseudomonas species of Andrographis paniculata which showed resistance only to amoxycillin (Arunachalam and Gayathri 2010). Many natural products produced by endophytes have proven to be antibacterial, antifungal, antidiabetic, antioxidants and immunosuppressives and great source of bioactive natural products. The majority of endophytic bacteria produced different kinds of novel antibiotics like Ecomycins, Pseudomycins, Munumbicins, Kakadumycins. These compounds inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Christina et al. 2013).

The bacterial strains secrete different types of natural products to inhibit or kill a wide variety of harmful disease-causing agents including, bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoans that affect humans and animals (Demain 1981). The bacterial secretes 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), phycocyanin, siderophores, lytic enzymes, chitenase which degrade the cell wall of pathogens and act as natural biological control. In present investigation the strain B. cereus (ECL1) and P. putida (ECL5) have shown the inhibition zones and indicated a strong antibacterial property among the all isolates.

During the antifungal activity the tested fungal strain are potent pathogens and cause severe infection to living organisms. Fusarium solani is a filamentous fungus commonly isolated from the soil and plant debris. A. alternata is known to produce mycotoxins, A. pullulans and B. fulva are responsible for fruit rot in certain plants. The antifungal activity of the isolated strains is due to the secretes of the strains like lytic enzymes, chitenase, production of certain antibiotics. Our finding showed that all bacterial isolates posses antifungal characteristics against above pathogens except the strain Bacillus sp. (ECL3) and C. michiganensis (ECL6), which did not show fungistatic activity against the fungal strain B. fulva and A. pullulans and they may be helpful to host for resistance against virulent fungi.
