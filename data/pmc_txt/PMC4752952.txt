
Abstract

Plant defensins are antifungal peptides produced by the innate immune system plants developed to circumvent fungal infection. The defensin Drr230a, originally isolated from pea, has been previously shown to be active against various entomopathogenic and phytopathogenic fungi. In the present study, the activity of a yeast-expressed recombinant Drr230a protein (rDrr230a) was tested against impacting soybean and cotton fungi. First, the gene was subcloned into the yeast expression vector pPICZαA and expressed in Pichia pastoris. Resulting rDrr230a exhibited in vitro activity against fungal growth and spore germination of Fusarium tucumaniae, which causes soybean sudden death syndrome, and against Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides, which causes cotton ramulosis. The rDrr230a IC50 corresponding to inhibition of fungal growth of F. tucumaniae and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides was 7.67 and 0.84 µM, respectively, demonstrating moderate activity against F. tucumaniae and high potency against C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides. Additionally, rDrr230a at 25 ng/µl (3.83 µM) resulted in 100 % inhibition of spore germination of both fungi, demonstrating that rDrr230a affects fungal development since spore germination. Moreover, rDrr230a at 3 µg/µl (460.12 µM) inhibited 100 % of in vitro spore germination of the obligatory biotrophic fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi, which causes Asian soybean rust. Interestingly, rDrr230a substantially decreased the severity of Asian rust, as demonstrated by in planta assay. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a plant defensin active against an obligatory biotrophic phytopathogenic fungus. Results revealed the potential of rDrr230a as a candidate to be used in plant genetic engineering to control relevant cotton and soybean fungal diseases.



Introduction

Plant diseases caused by fungi affect a broad range of crops worldwide, being responsible for significant losses and for the decrease in quality and safety of agricultural products. In crop plants, fungi cause more economic damage than any other group of microorganisms, with annual losses estimated at more than US$ 200 billion (Horbach et al. 2011). There are several fungal diseases impacting in tropical areas, which include cotton ramulosis, Asian soybean rust and soybean sudden death syndrome caused by Colletotrichum gossypii (South) var. cephalosporioides A. S. Costa, Phakopsora pachyrhizi H. & P. Syd., and Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. f. sp. glycines (= Fusarium tucumaniae T.) (Aoki et al. 2003), respectively. Currently, there are no cotton or soybean varieties with good agronomic traits, which at the same time present high resistance against these important diseases. In addition, none of these diseases are satisfactorily controlled by fungicides.

To circumvent fungal infection, plants have developed innate immune systems that recognize the presence of pathogens and initiate effective defense responses (Muthamilarasan and Prasad 2013). Therefore, plants produce diverse molecules such as carbohydrates, lipids (Rojas et al. 2014), antimicrobial enzymes (Habib and Fazili 2007), secondary metabolites, (Ahuja et al. 2012; Bednarek 2012) and several defense-related proteins such as chitinases, glucanases, lectins, thionins, and defensins (Carvalho and Gomes 2009).

Defensins, which are pathogenesis-related proteins produced by plants, invertebrate and vertebrate animals, are basic, small (around 50 amino acids, about 5 kDa), cysteine-rich-peptides whose three-dimensional structure presents one α-helix and three antiparallel β-sheets stabilized by an αβ motif (Lay and Anderson 2005; Carvalho and Gomes 2009). Defensins have a broad range of biological activity, including inhibition of α-amylases (Bloch and Richardson 1991; Pelegrini et al. 2008) and proteases (Wijaya et al. 2000; Melo et al. 2002), antimicrobial activity (Ye and Ng 2001; Wong and Ng 2005; de Zélicourt et al. 2007), inhibition of protein synthesis (Mendez et al. 1990, 1996), blockage of ionic channels (Spelbrink et al. 2004) and interference in cell cycle by DNA binding (Lobo et al. 2007).

Transgenic plants expressing defensins have been shown to be an alternative strategy to protect plants against pathogens (De Bondt et al. 1999; Gao et al. 2000; Parashina et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2002, 2006; Park et al. 2002; Chan et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2007; Anuradha et al. 2008; Choy et al. 2009; Kovalskaya and Hammond 2009; Abdallah et al. 2010; Jha and Chattoo 2010) specially in case there is no source of natural resistance for breeding programs.

The pea (Pisum sativum) defensin Drr230a, transgenically expressed in tobacco, has been previously shown to present antimicrobial activity against the entomopathogenic fungus Trichoderma reesei and against the phytopathogenic fungi F. solani, F. oxysporum, Ascochyta pisi, A. pinodes, A. lentis, Alternaria alternata, and Leptosphaeria maculans (Lai et al. 2002).

Considering the potential of Drr230a to control other relevant fungal diseases in agriculture, in the present study, we describe the expression of the drr230a gene in Pichia pastoris, the purification of the resulting recombinant Drr230a (rDrr230a) and evaluations of its activity against the impacting cotton and soybean fungi C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides, P. pachyrhizi and F. tucumaniae.
