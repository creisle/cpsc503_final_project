Siderophores are low-molecular-weight, iron-scavenging ligands produced by a wide variety of microorganisms to combat iron deficiency (Sayyed et al. 2013). Siderophores of rhizobacteria provide iron nutrition to the plants and help in plant-growth promotion. They prevent the plant pathogens from iron nutrition; thereby restricting its growth, and thus, help in biological control of phytopathogens (Shaikh et al. 2014). Besides these, siderophores are also used in pharmaceuticals (Crumbliss and Harrington 2009; Hider and Kong 2010), bioremediation of heavy metal pollutants (Rajkumar et al. 2010), biogeochemical cycling of iron in the ocean (Boyd et al. 2007), biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons (Hickford et al. 2004; Gauglitz et al. 2012), and as an optical biosensor (Yoder and Kisaalita 2011; Ahmed and Holmström 2014). Since these molecules have wider range of applications, their production needs to be statistically optimized. Hence, any factor, which influences the production of siderophores in a production medium, needs to be studied.

Non-statistical optimization approach considers only one factor at a time. It is tedious and time-consuming, especially for multi-variable screening, and it does not consider the complex interactions among different variables (Bas and Boyac 2007; Hegde et al. 2013). Statistical-based approaches offer ideal ways for process-optimization studies in several biochemical and biotechnological processes (Bas and Boyac 2007) such as amylase production (Gangadharan et al. 2008; Prajapati et al. 2015), ethanol production (Mei et al. 2009), hydrogen production (Guo et al. 2009), phytase production (Singh and Satyanarayana 2008), avermectin production (Gao et al. 2009), phenazine-1-carboxylic acid production (Su et al. 2010), cellulose production (Mohite et al. 2012), and cellulase production (Hegde et al. 2013; Thakkar and Saraf 2014). However, there are very few reports on statistical optimization of siderophore production.

Present work focuses on statistical-based optimization approaches, i.e., Plackett–Burman (PB) design and response surface methodology (RSM) by central composite design (CCD), for enhanced production of siderophore by using succinate medium. Scale-up of optimized shake flask protocol to laboratory-scale bioreactor was also studied.
