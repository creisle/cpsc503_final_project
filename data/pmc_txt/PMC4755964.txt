Biodegradation of the pesticides is considered as one of the safest and cheapest ways. The aim of the present study was to reveal if the inoculated Lactic acid bacteria widely used in silage could provide beneficial safety to guarantee dairy feedstuffs and fresh milk. Organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) degradation in whole corn silage was investigated. Two OPPs, chlorpyrifos and phorate, were added to the whole corn, which was inoculated with L. plantarum 1.0315, L. plantarum 1.0624, L. plantarum 1.0622 and their combination at room temperature for 10 weeks. OPPs residues in the whole corn silage at different weeks were analyzed by gas chromatography after OPPs extraction and purification. The degradation rate constants were calculated according to the OPPs residues results at different fermentation stage. The data showed that the inoculated microorganisms and strain combination exhibited obvious acceleration on OPPs degradation as the wild microorganisms did, and resulted in decreased levels of OPPs from 24.9 to 33.4 %. Strains combination brought about greater OPPs degradation than single strain or the wild microorganisms. Compared to phorate, clorpyrifos had lower degradation rate constants (0.0274–0.0381 vs. 0.0295–0.0355 week−1) and was more stable. The present result indicates safety benefit of lactic acid bacteria on corn silage besides lactic acid fermentation.



Introduction

Organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) are a group of toxic agricultural chemicals widely used to control insect pests, plant pathogens, and weeds for plant protection to increase agricultural productivity. OPPs bring about enormous economic benefits to the farmers, and also raise potential risk to the health of animal especially humans (Sogorb et al. 2004). OPPs will pollute the environment eventually reach water (Na et al. 2006), soil (Cycón et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2004), animal feeds (Kumar et al. 2013). For example, OPPs were detected in the corn planted in Ghana (Akoto et al. 2013). The remaining OPPs in silage might not lead to the critical contamination of fresh milk and dairy products, but some analyses did observe OPPs residues in milk and dairy products (Tsiplakou et al. 2010; Battu et al. 2004). OPPs pollution in processed foods has been paid more and more attention all over the world (Abdel-Halim et al. 2006). There were some studies using microbial degradation to control OPPs (El Fantroussi and Agathos 2005; Fang et al. 2006), as biodegradation of the pesticides is considered as one of the safest and cheapest ways.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as the natural intestinal microbiota of most animals (Rojo-Bezares et al. 2006), is one of the most common microorganisms in foods (De Vuyst and Leroy 2007), and also widely used in silage and inoculated in an effort to improve their preservation or quality (Addah et al. 2010; Danner et al. 2003; Filya 2003). Some intestinal microorganisms including LAB were efficient in degrading the OPPs (Harishankar et al. 2013). Two researchers reported that LAB had ability to enhance the degradation of some OPPs in the skimmed milk (Bo et al. 2011; Zhao and Wang 2012). Islam et al. revealed the OPPs biodegradation mechanism by expressing a gene encoding OPPs hydrolase enzyme from LAB. The phosphatase produced by LAB in the fermentation system might be the important factor for OPPs degradation (Zhang et al. 2014). L. plantarum as the main inoculants in the silage processing has the ability to accelerate OPPs degradation. Unfortunately, there were few researches studying OPPs degradation in silage. In the present study, OPPs degradation in whole corn silage was investigated. The potential impacts of three LAB including L. plantarum 1.0622, L. plantarum 1.0315 and L. plantarum 1.0624 on the degradation of chlorpyrifos and phorate were evaluated and compared, based on the calculated degradation kinetics of first-order reaction. The aim of the present study was to reveal if the inoculated LAB could provide beneficial safety guarantee to dairy feedstuffs and fresh milk.
