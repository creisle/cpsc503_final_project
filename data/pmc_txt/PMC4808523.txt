
Abstract

Genetic diversity among 23 rice genotypes including wild species and cultivars of indica, japonica, aus and aromatic type was investigated using 165 genomewide core set microsatellite (SSR) markers. This genotypic characterization was undertaken to know the genetic similarity among the parental lines to be used in developing a set of chromosome segment substitution lines. In all, 253 alleles were identified using 77 polymorphic SSRs, and polymorphism information content ranged from 0.31 to 0.97 with a mean of 0.79. Cluster analysis grouped the genotypes into three clusters at a genetic similarity of 0.26â€“0.75. Wild accessions grouped together in cluster-I, indica cultivars formed cluster-II, and aromatic, japonica and aus types came under cluster-III. Principal component analysis also showed similar results. The genotypic data was analyzed using STRUCTURE, and genotypes were grouped into four populations. RM1018 on chromosome 4, RM8009 on chromosome 7, and RM273 on chromosome 12 amplified alleles specific to wild accessions. The information obtained from core set markers would help in selecting diverse parents including wild accessions and for tracking alleles in mapping or breeding populations.

Introduction

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most extensively cultivated cereal crops in the world spreading across a wide range of geographical, ecological and climatic regions. High genotypic and phenotypic diversity exists, and about 1,20,000 different accessions are reported in rice as a consequence of varied adaptations (Das et al. 2013). Large collections of rice germplasm consisting of cultivars of indica, japonica and javanica sub-species along with landraces are conserved in global gene banks (Khush 1997; Tanksley and McCouch 1997; Lu et al. 2005; Garris et al. 2005). Wild accessions of rice are potential reservoir of valuable genes that could be exploited for crop improvement programs (Brar and Khush 1997). There was a significant reduction in genetic diversity during the course of domestication from wild relatives to cultivated rice (Brar and Khush 2003; Sun et al. 2001). In spite of the richness of genetic resources, only a small proportion has been utilized in breeding programs, resulting in high genetic similarity in commercial rice cultivars (Das et al. 2013). To meet the future requirements of food, the yield potential of the varieties has to be improved, but it is difficult due to narrow genetic base of the popular varieties. To break the yield plateau, it is essential to broaden the genetic base of the varieties by introgressions from distant or newer gene pools. Assessment and introgression of the available genetic diversity in germplasm resources is required for detection of novel genes or QTLs for agronomically important traits.

Knowledge of the genetic diversity and genetic relationships between germplasm accessions is the basic foundation for crop improvement programs (Thomson et al. 2008). Domestication and artificial selection pressure changed the genome compositions and population structure of the available germplasm resources (Huang et al. 2012; Yadong et al. 2012). In depth analysis of population structure is required before initiating any breeding program to get targeted improvement in the traits. There are several ways for estimation of diversity in germplasm viz, evaluation of phenotypic variation, biochemical and DNA polymorphisms. However, both phenotypic and biochemical characterizations are not much reliable because they are environmentally influenced, labor demanding, numerically and phenologically limited, but DNA-based molecular markers are ubiquitous, repeatable, stable and highly reliable (Virk et al. 2000; Song et al. 2003). Among the several classes of available DNA markers, microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are considered the most suitable due to their multi-allelic nature, high reproducibility, codominant inheritance, abundance and extensive genome coverage (Orjuela et al. 2010). In rice, high-density SSR map with genome coverage of approximately 2 SSRs per centimorgan (cM) (McCouch et al. 2002) and a universal core genetic map (UCGM) (Orjuela et al. 2010) were reported. These maps can help in accurately assessing genomewide diversity. Many researchers evaluated genetic diversity of Indian rice germplasm using other SSRs, but SSRs from UCGM have not been used for studying diversity previously (Saini et al. 2004; Jain et al. 2004; Ram et al. 2007; Sundaram et al. 2008; Kumar et al. 2010; Sivaranjani et al. 2010; Vanniarajan et al. 2012; Yadav et al. 2013). Studies were also conducted globally on classifying rice genotypes based on their genetic diversity and population structure using molecular markers (Garris et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2010; Jin et al. 2010; Li et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2014; Raimondi et al. 2014; Shinada et al. 2014). Most of the diversity studies in rice mainly focused on clustering within cultivated rice group and only few studies were reported using accessions from wild rice species in diversity analysis (Ni et al. 2002; Ravi et al. 2003; Caicedo et al. 2007; Ram et al. 2007). The present study was aimed at investigating the diversity and relationship among selected wild rice accessions and cultivars using SSR markers for the identification of diverse genotypes and polymorphic markers for further utilization in inter-specific breeding programs, and for the development CSSL population from elite/wild crosses.
