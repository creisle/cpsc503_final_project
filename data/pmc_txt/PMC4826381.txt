
Abstract

Two bacterial strains phylogenetically identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains RM1 and SK1 displayed extensive degradation ability on waste engine oil (SAE 40W) in batch cultures. Spectrophotometric analysis revealed the presence of various heavy metals such as lead, chromium and nickel in the waste engine oil. The rate of degradation of waste engine oil by the isolates, for the first 12 days and the last 9 days were 66.3, 31.6 mg l−1 day−1  and 69.6, 40.0 mg l−1 day−1 for strains RM1 and SK1, respectively. Gas chromatographic (GC) analyses of residual waste engine oil, revealed that 66.58, 89.06 % and 63.40, 90.75 % of the initial concentration of the waste engine oil were degraded by strains RM1 and SK1 within 12 and 21 days. GC fingerprints of the waste engine oil after 12 days of incubation of strains RM1 and SK1 showed total disappearance of C15, C23, C24, C25 and C26 hydrocarbon fractions as well as drastic reductions of C13, C14, C16 and PAHs fractions such as C19-anthracene and C22-pyrene. At the end of 21 days incubation, total disappearance of C17-pristane, C22-pyrene, one of the C19-anthracene and significant reduction of C18-phytane (97.2 %, strain RM1; 95.1 %, strain SK1) fractions were observed. In addition, <10 % of Day 0 values of medium fraction ranges C13, and C16 were discernible after 21 days. This study has established the potentials of P. aeruginosa strains RM1 and SK1 in the degradation of aliphatic, aromatic and branched alkane components of waste engine oils.



Introduction

Waste engine oil is a brown to black oil removed from automobiles when oil is changed. It markedly differs from fresh engine oil as it contains minute quantities of additives and metallic salts. It also contains higher concentrations of heavy metal contaminants that are dangerous to living organisms such as lead, zinc, calcium, barium and magnesium as well as lower concentrations of iron, sodium, copper, aluminum, chromium, manganese, potassium, nickel, and molybdenum resulting from engine wear (Mumford et al. 1986; Vazquez-Duhalt and Greppin 1986).

There is serious environmental concern on the composition of the additives used in engine oil as some of them including zinc diaryl or diakyl dithiophosphates, molybdenum disulphide, heavy metal soaps and organometallic compounds, which contain heavy metals, are dangerous environmental contaminants (Vazquez-Duhalt 1989).

Due to high temperature and mechanical strains the engine oil is subjected to during engine operation, the oil is chemically transformed by oxidation, nitration, cracking of polymers and decomposition of organometallic compounds. Consequent upon this, the waste engine oil accumulates different contaminants such as fuel (petrol or diesel), water, antifreeze and insoluble particles, which principally originates from atmospheric dust, metals, metal oxides and combustion products (Vazquez-Duhalt 1989).

Aside from these dangerous contaminants, waste engine oil also contains other contaminants such as higher percentages of alkyl benzenes, naphthalenes, methylnaphthalenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) due to pyrosynthesis and chlorodibenzofurans (Wang et al. 2000; Dominguez-Rosado and Pitchell 2003; Lu and Isaac 2008). The PAHs content of new engine oil is relatively low, but increases with engine operation time (Pruell and Quinn 1988; Wong and Wang 2001). Disposal of waste engine oil that is rich in PAHs is a serious health and environmental concern because some PAHs are known to be mutagenic and carcinogenic (Obayori et al. 2008; Salam et al. 2014).

Generally, waste engine oil enters the environment through accidental spills, indiscriminate disposal and operations by automobile mechanics. The Nigerian environment is characterized by nonchalant, indiscriminate and highly unregulated disposal of petroleum products including engine oil (Odjegba and Sadiq 2000; Obayori et al. 2010). Automobile workshops often dispose waste oil on open grounds where it subsequently finds its way into drainages, canals and underground water resulting in gross pollution and constituting potential threats to humans, animals, soil and vegetation (Edewor et al. 2004; Bagherzadeh-Namazi et al. 2008). Observations had shown that even small release of petroleum hydrocarbons into aquifers could lead to concentrations of dissolved hydrocarbons far in excess of regulatory limits (Spence et al. 2005).

Prolonged exposure and high oil concentration may cause the development of liver or kidney disease, possible damage to the bone marrow and an increased risk of cancer (Lloyd and Cackette 2001; Mishra et al. 2001). They are capable of causing different undesirable changes in the environment and in the anatomical features of man (Akoachere et al. 2008). Hydrocarbon pollution have been reported to have inhibitory effect on photosynthesis of phytoplankton communities, as waste engine oil is one of the most important mutagenic agents in the aquatic environment (Vazquez-Duhalt 1989).

Furthermore, research findings have shown statistically significant impact of such reckless disposal on plants, including height reduction, chlorophyll loss and protein level reduction (Oluwole et al. 2005; Umechuruba 2005).

Bioremediation is the exploitation of degradative competencies of microorganisms to remove the environmental pollutants and recalcitrant xenobiotics (Habe et al. 2001). Bioremediation remains one of the most effective ways to reclaim soils and aquifers polluted with petroleum hydrocarbons. Such efforts would depend on the availability of petrophilic organisms with capacity to degrade the broad array of components in the contaminant. Reports abound of degraders of engine oil and waste engine oil spanning strains of genera such as Acinetobacter, Achromobacter, Arthrobacter, Flavobacterium, and Pseudomonas among others (Adelowo et al. 2006; Mandri and Lin 2007; Bagherzadeh-Namazi et al. 2008; Basuki et al. 2011; Obayori et al. 2014; Salam et al. 2015).

Oftentimes, individual strains are only capable of degrading a few components of the oil pollutant, and complete biodegradation require the activity of consortium (Lal and Khanna 1996; Adebusoye et al. 2007). However, there is increasing research in the isolation of individual organism that can not only degrade the major components of engine oils but also demonstrate versatility for other more recalcitrant hydrocarbons, as oftentimes these pollutants are found together in the same environmental compartments. Here, we report the degradation of waste engine oil by two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from tropical hydrocarbon-contaminated soil in Lagos, Nigeria.



Discussion

Biodegradation is a process by which microorganisms transform or mineralize the molecular structure of an environmental pollutant through metabolic or enzymatic processes into less harmful, non-hazardous substances, which are subsequently integrated into natural biogeochemical cycles. The mechanisms of adaptation of autochthonous microorganisms to hydrocarbon perturbations includes synthesis of inducible enzymes, mutations such as single nucleotide change or DNA rearrangement that results in degradation of the compound and acquisition of genetic information from closely related or phylogenetically distinct population within the hydrocarbon-challenged community through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (Top and Springael 2003; Salam et al. 2011).

The present study investigated the degradative ability of two P. aeruginosa strains on waste engine oil. The genus Pseudomonas encompasses arguably the most diverse and ecologically significant group of bacteria due to their remarkable degree of physiological and genetic adaptability. Pseudomonas is reputed to possess broad substrate affinity for different classes of hydrocarbons such as alicyclics, heterocyclics, and aromatics (Vankateswaran et al. 1995; Nojiri et al. 1999; Obayori et al. 2008; Salam et al. 2014).

In this study, the isolates showed extensive degradative abilities on different hydrocarbon fractions of the spent SAE40 engine oil concomitant with increase in population density. The growth rates of strains RM1 and SK1 on waste SAE40 were 0.377 and 0.381 day−1, respectively. These values are higher than 0.13 and 0.1 day−1 reported for waste engine oil degrading Pseudomonas sp. LP5 and Methylobacterium mesophilicum strain RD1 isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated soils in Lagos, Nigeria (Obayori et al. 2014; Salam et al. 2015). The high growth rates may be attributed to previous exposure and consequent adaptation of the isolates to the pollutant as routine indiscriminate disposal of waste engine oil is a regular occurrence at automobile workshops.

Despite the presence of recalcitrant hydrocarbon fractions as well as heavy metals and combustion products in waste engine oil (Table 1), the two P. aeruginosa strains degraded more than 60 and 80 % of waste SAE40 engine oil in 12 and 21 days. Strain RM1 degraded 65.58 and 89.06 % while strain SK1 degraded 63.40 and 90.75 % of waste engine oil in 12 and 21 days, respectively. These degradation rates are higher than 60, 71 and 84 % in 28 days reported for Flavobacterium sp, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticum isolated from contaminated soils in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa (Mandri and Lin 2007). It is equally higher than 81 % in 28 days and 89.5 % in 21 days (strain SK1 only) reported for P. aeruginosa and Methylobacterium mesophilicum strain RD1 isolated from hydrocarbon-polluted sites (Thenmozhi et al. 2011; Salam et al. 2015). It is, however, lower than 93 % in 21 days reported for P. aeruginosa LP5 (Obayori et al. 2014).

Significant reduction in peaks between Day 0 and Day 12 concomitant with exponential growth of strains RM1 and SK1, which extend to Day 15 indicate that the degradation of the waste engine oil is growth associated with the isolates utilizing the hydrocarbon substrate as carbon and energy source. The total disappearance of C15, C23, C24, C25 and C26 hydrocarbon fractions on Day 12 suggests that the fractions may be saturated alkanes, which are amenable to complete degradation or disintegration to shorter hydrocarbon fractions. This possibly explains the emergence of <C9 hydrocarbon fractions (C1, C2, C4, C6, C8) on Day 12 hitherto not present on Day 0.

The drastic reduction by the two strains of C13 and C16 hydrocarbon fractions by >90 % over the 21 days incubation period indicates the catabolic versatility of this strain. Furthermore, the complete degradation of polyaromatic fractions C19-A (anthracene), and C22-P (pyrene) in the used engine oil by Day 21 as indicated in the GC fingerprints suggest that this isolate possess multiple degradative genes with diverse catabolic ability. This rare ability to degrade aliphatic, aromatic and polyaromatic fractions displayed by the isolates debunk the belief that individual organisms could only metabolize limited range of hydrocarbon substrates (Adebusoye et al. 2007).

Acyclic isoprenoid hydrocarbons such as pristane (2, 6, 10, 14-tetramethyl pentadecane) and phytane (2, 6, 10, 14-tetramethyl hexadecane) are highly persistent during the degradation of crude oil and petroleum products (Bartha and Atlas 1977; Atlas 1981). This explains why they are used as internal biomarkers in environmental hydrocarbon analyses. The persistence may be attributed to either the presence of alkyl branches, which hinder the uptake of the hydrocarbons into the cell, or non-susceptibility of the branches to the enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway (Schaeffer et al. 1979). However, few bacteria are known to be able to oxidize these recalcitrant hydrocarbons. For instance, Nakajima et al. reported a Rhodococcus sp. that have the potential to degrade and utilize phytane, norpristane (2, 6, 10-trimethylpentadecane) and farnesane (2, 6, 10-trimethyldodecane) as sole sources of carbon and energy. Also, Silva et al. reported the biodegradation of phytane by Mycobacterium ratisbonense strain SD4 under nitrogen-starved conditions. In this study, two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains RM1 and SK1 degraded C17-pristane (67.2 %, strain RM1; 64.3 % strain SK1) and C18-phytane (92.9 %, strain RM1; 91.2 % strain SK1) hydrocarbon fractions of the waste engine oil in 12 days. However, after 21 days of incubation, >95 % of C18-phytane fraction was degraded (97.2 %, strain RM1; 95.1 %, strain SK1) while there is complete degradation of C17-pristane fraction in the hexane extracts of residual waste engine oil of the two strains. This indicates that strains RM1 and SK1 harbor multiple degradative genes with propensity for degradation of aliphatic, aromatic, polyaromatic and acyclic isoprenoid components of the waste engine oil.
