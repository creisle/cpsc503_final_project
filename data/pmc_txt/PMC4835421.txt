Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is an outrageous disease worldwide. l-Asparagine (l-Asn) and l-glutamine (l-Gln) deamination plays crucial role in ALL treatment. Role of Erwinaze® (l-asparaginase from Erwinia chrysanthemi) in regulation of l-Asn and l-Gln has been confirmed by the experimental studies. Therapeutic research against ALL remained elusive with the lack of structural information on Erwinaze® enzyme. In this present study, homology model of the Erwinaze® was developed using MODELLER and the same was validated by various quality indexing tools. For the apo state enzyme and ligand bound state complexes molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed. The trajectory analysis showed the confirmational changes of structures in the dynamic system. Ligand binding mechanisms were studied using different docking tools to interpret the various ligand-receptor interactions and binding free energies. MD simulation of docked complex with l-Gln ligand substrate showed the defined structural folding with stable conformation over the l-Asn complex in dynamic environment. This research reports give much more information on structural and functional aspects of Erwinaze® with its ligands which may be useful in designing of effective therapeutics for ALL.

Introduction

Leukemic cell’s inability to synthesize l-Asn on their own has primed l-Asparaginase enzyme as a dynamic factor of chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy (Ohnuma et al. 1970; Wriston and Yellin 1973). In blood vascular system, l-Asparaginase hydrolyses l-Asn into l-Aspartic acid and ammonia building the leukemic cells barren of essential exogenous l-Asn, leading to protein synthesis inhibition followed by apoptosis (Lubkowski et al. 1994; Neuman and McCoy 1956; Mashburn and Wriston 1964), hence making this potent against ALL.

Nowadays, salable l-Asparaginases are predominantly produced from E. coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi (Godfrin and Bertrand 2006). Apart from direct production from various bacterial and fungal strains, several attempts were also made for the production of recombinant enzyme by cloning and expression of l-Asparaginase encoding genes from Erwinia chrysanthemi (Kotzia and Labrou 2007) and Erwinia carotovora (Kotzia and Labrou 2005) and other microbes in E. coli. It is found that against the cells of reverted ALL patients, the commercial anti-cancer enzyme has in vitro resistance (Klumper et al. 1995) along with its high glutaminase activity and low substrate specificity, causing pancreatitis, liver dysfunction, coagulation anomalies causing intracranial thrombosis or hemorrhage, neurological seizures and leucopenia (Duval et al. 2002). l-Glutaminase activity of same enzyme leading to deamination of l-Gln to l-Glutamate in blood plasma induces some toxic effects in normal cells (Capizzi and Cheng 1981; Storti and Quaglino 1970). This facilitates the necessity for novel and healthy l-Asparaginases from innocuous microorganisms with elevated substrate affinity, amended stability, low glutaminase activity, adequate half-life and least KM value under physiological conditions to overcome the above said challenges encountered in the recent scenario. Though we have sufficient data on the production, optimization of bioprocess and purification of enzyme etc., no research has been done on the molecular aspects of the enzyme from Erwinia chrysanthemi. In the absence of crystal structure it is highly difficult to get the molecular information about the enzyme like its interactions with the substrates, enzyme stability etc. Therefore, the current study is aimed towards the in silico modeling of l-Asparaginase structure from Erwinia chrysanthemi, molecular interactions with the substrates through docking, and testing the stability of the enzyme and docked complexes under physiological conditions by molecular dynamic simulations methods.
