Lipases (triacylglycerol acylhydrolases, EC 3.1.1.3) are enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to glycerol and free fatty acids (Sharma and Kanwar 2014). Lipases from microorganisms are considered better than those obtained from plants or animals because of faster production, higher yields and greater stability. The enzyme production can be enhanced by selection of potent strains, genetic manipulation and optimization of growth conditions (Dayanandan et al. 2013).

High production cost of lipase is a major hurdle in its application in industrial processes. Therefore, various attempts have been made to lower the cost of its production (Smaniotto et al. 2012). Fungi are usually preferred as lipase producers because they synthesize extracellular enzymes that can be easily extracted from the production media (Maia et al. 1999). However, the synthesis of fungal lipases is governed by both nutritional and physico-chemical parameters such as pH, temperature and level of dissolved oxygen.

Some of the applications of lipases include synthesis of organic chemicals, flavour enhancement during cheese production and treatment of high fat-containing waste water (Sharma et al. 2001). Fungal lipases are extensively used in the detergent industries for removal of tough oily stains from fabrics. Rapid degradation of oils with better specificity even under mild conditions has made these enzymes useful in the formulation of soaps and production of biosurfactants (Gopinath et al. 2003). However, very few studies which discuss the characterization of surfactant-compatible fungal lipases are available. A detailed analysis of lipase properties facilitates its application in relevant industrial processes (Borrelli and Trono 2015). Owing to the continuous demand for fungal lipases in various industrial sectors, the present study was undertaken with the objectives of purification, characterization and determination of the oil-destaining potential of lipase from a selected fungal isolate.
