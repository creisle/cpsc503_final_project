
Abstract

Rice fields are one of the important sources of anthropogenic methane. Methanotrophs can oxidize up to 30 % of the produced methane and thus have a pivotal environmental role in methane mitigation. India occupies the largest region under rice cultivation; however, most of the studies done on methanotrophic communities have focused on the Northern region. We studied methanotrophic community of a flooded, organically fertilized rice field using pmoA clone library approach. Organic rice fields impose a more serious threat as they produce more methane. pmoA gene is the main functional gene which is primarily used for taxonomical analysis of methanotrophs. Our results showed that the pmoA clone libraries from two growth stages of rice were dominated by pmoA sequences which were very distant from cultivated Type Ia methanotrophic genera (80–82 % nucleotide similarity) indicative of the presence of a putatively novel genus. We designated this group of clones as ‘rice field clones’ as this also includes many pmoA sequences originating from other rice fields. Thus, our current knowledge of methanotroph diversity from Indian rice fields has been expanded revealing that a substantial portion of methanotrophic diversity is unexplored.
