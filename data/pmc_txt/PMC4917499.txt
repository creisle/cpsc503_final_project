
Abstract

A nitrile utilizing bacterium Rhodococcus sp. MTB5 was previously isolated in our laboratory by the enrichment culture technique. It is able to utilize butyronitrile as sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. Maximum butyronitrile degrading property of this strain has been investigated. Results reveal that 100, 98, and 88 % degradation was achieved for 2, 2.5, and 3 % butyronitrile, respectively. The strain is capable of growing in as high as 5 % butyronitrile concentration. A two-step pathway involving nitrile hydratase (NHase) and amidase was observed for the biodegradation of butyronitrile. Complete degradation (mineralization) of butyronitrile with the help of metabolite feeding experiment was reported. The significance of this investigation was the capability of the strain to completely degrade and its ability to grow on higher concentrations of butyronitrile. These potential features make it a suitable candidate for practical field application for effective in situ bioremediation of butyronitrile contaminated sites.



Introduction

Nitriles are the cyanide containing compounds (R–CN) and are widespread in the environment as a result of biological and industrial activity (Legras et al. 1990). They are used as preliminary materials for the synthesis of a numerous fine chemicals (Banerjee et al. 2002). Butyronitrile is an aliphatic nitrile, clear colourless liquid with a suffocating odour resembling bitter almond oil. It is miscible with most polar organic solvents, hence finds applications in the industries in making other chemicals. It is mainly used as a precursor to the poultry drug amprolium (Peter et al. 2002). Amprolium is a coccidiostat (antiprotozoal agent) used in the poultry that acts upon coccidia parasites. Amprolium is prepared using commercially available butyronitrile as starting material. It is also used in electrolyte composition in dye-sensitized solar cells (Sauvage et al. 2011). A number of nitriles have been reported as potent carcinogenic, mutagenic, and toxic in nature (Ramakrishna et al. 1999). The use of nitriles as bulk solvents has increased their distribution in the environment and needs their remediation (Ebbs 2004). The chemical hydrolysis of these compounds necessitates harsh conditions, such as extremes of pH and elevated temperatures with the creation of significant quantities of by-products and secondary pollutants (Kobayashi and Shimizu 2000; Prasad et al. 2009). Bioremediation is one such method used for the detoxification of contaminated sites. It is an inexpensive technology, and can either eliminate these compounds by degrading them to harmless intermediates or, in due course, to carbon dioxide and water (Nawaz et al. 1991).

The nitrile converting enzymes occur in a wide variety of plants, bacteria, and in some fungi. The microbial hydrolysis of nitriles begins through two key enzymatic pathways (Fig. 1). First, the nitrile hydratases hydrolyze nitriles to amides and by amidases to the corresponding carboxylic acids and ammonia (Kobayashi and Shimizu 1998; Sharma et al. 2013). Second, nitrilases directly convert nitriles to acids and ammonia (Kobayashi and Shimizu 2000).Fig. 1General catabolic pathways (NHase: amidase and nitrilase) for degradation of organic nitriles

Microbial degradation of different types of nitriles has been reported using different strains (Wang et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2010; Fang et al. 2015). However, there are limited reports in the literature about the biodegradation of butyronitrile (Wenzhong et al. 1991; Nawaz et al. 1992). To the best of our knowledge, no reports are available on the proof of complete degradation of nitriles by metabolite feeding experiment. In the present communication, we report the maximum degradation of butyronitrile of 3 % and the ability of the strain to grow in a mineral salts (MS) medium containing as high as 5 % butyronitrile. This is the first report on the highest degradation of any nitrile reported and the confirmation of complete degradation by metabolite feeding experiment.
