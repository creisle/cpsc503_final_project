
Abstract

The biggest agricultural sector that contributes to the Malaysian economy is the oil palm industry. The effluent generated during the production of crude palm oil known as palm oil mill effluent (POME). POME undergoes anaerobic treatment that requires long retention time and produces large amount of methane that consequently contributes to global warming. In this study, an isolated bacteria was selected based on its ability to degrade kraft lignin (KL) and identified as Ochrobactrum sp. The bacteria were able to treat POME (from anaerobic pond) under the aerobic condition without addition of nutrient, resulting in a significant chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 71 %, removal rate of 1385 mg/l/day, and 12.3 times higher than that of the ponding system. It has also resulted in 60 % removal of ammoniacal nitrogen and 55 % of total polyphenolic after 6-day treatment period with the detection of lignocellulolytic enzymes.



Introduction

Oil palm industries contribute to the major economy of the agricultural sector in Malaysia as early as 1917. A total of 426 mills were in operation in 2011, where production of crude palm oil was 24.97 million tonnes (MPOB 2013). The earnest revenue collected from the palm oil industry has a huge contribution towards Malaysia’s development and improved standard of living. Nevertheless, the extraction of oil from the palm fruit requires large volume of water which subsequently produces wastewater high in COD values in the range of 15,000–100,000 mg/l. The palm oil mill industry has also been identified as the largest contributor to the pollution load in rivers in Malaysia, stimulating an intensive search for an alternative method which is environmentally friendly for the degradation of pollutant in POME.

With increasing government demand for environmental friendly industrial processing systems, the oil palm industry in Malaysia has been facing challenges treating the POME economically, as well as fulfilling the discharge limit stipulated by the government (Wu et al. 2010). There have been several reports on biological treatment of POME, such as on raw POME (Vijayaraghavan et al. 2007; Cheng et al. 2010) and final POME (Neoh et al. 2013b, 2015; Georgiou et al. 2016). However, to the best of our knowledge, bioremediation of POME from anaerobic pond (AnPOME) has not been previously reported. There are various methods that have been used in the treatment of POME. Liew et al. reviewed most of the polishing treatment systems for POME and suggested that membrane filtration processes, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) with addition of hydrogen peroxide or Fenton reagent were more effective for the treatment of POME. However, the maintenance cost for MBR bioreactor was expensive due to biofouling as POME contained high concentration of suspended solids (El-Shafey and Al-Hashmi 2013; Neoh et al. 2016). On the other hand, AOPs tend to produce highly toxic by-products. Abdullah et al. developed aerobic granular sludge for treatment of diluted raw POME, and it was efficient in the removal of COD. However, the major drawback of aerobic granulation is a long start-up period of granule formation from the flocs of activated sludge (Joo-Hwa Tay et al. 2006).

Currently, the existing POME treatment mainly involves ponding systems which comprise anaerobic and facultative stages. In Malaysia, over 85 % of the mills have adopted the conventional anaerobic ponding system that was based on suspended growth of activated sludge (Zahrim et al. 2009). The anaerobic pond is one of the intermediate ponds with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 30–80 days (Igwe and Onyegbado 2007). The anaerobic treatment is also considered as cost effective. However, anaerobic ponding system has several critical drawbacks that should be considered for further improvement, for example, extended period of HRT, solids accumulation, inconsistent nutrient removal, large land area requirement (Shilton 2006), and produced noxious odors. During the anaerobic process, a volume of 375,000,000 m3 methane is evolved from the open ponding systems, equivalent to 8,610,000,000 m3 of carbon dioxide production, which is 3.6 % of the estimated total emissions of greenhouse gases in Malaysia. POME is also one of the sources contributing to the global environmental issues specifically relating to climate change. Most of the oil palm industries in Malaysia are not equipped with biogas recovery systems due to the high capital and operating costs (Yeoh 2004). Hence, the biogas that is released into the atmosphere aggravates the effects of global warming. Since the objective of this study is to shorten the period for POME treatment, this will in turn help reduce emissions of greenhouse gases which will subsequently reduce the risks of global warming. POME contained high concentration of polyphenolic compounds which are carcinogenic, toxic, and creating unpleasant odor in water resources. Phenolic pollution has arisen as a serious problem, and there is a need for removal of phenolic in POME efficiently (Gholizadeh et al. 2013).

The main objective of this study was to treat AnPOME using single culture of bacteria. The bacteria were selected based on the ability to degrade KL. Parameters such as COD, pH, ammoniacal nitrogen, total polyphenolic compounds, lignin, color, heavy metal, and toxicity were also monitored. To the best of our knowledge, research utilizing Ochrobactrum sp. enzymatic systems for POME degradation has not been reported.
