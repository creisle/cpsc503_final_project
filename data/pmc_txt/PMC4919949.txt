
Abstract

The present study was evaluated to test the potential of plant growth-promoting actinobacteria in increasing seed mineral density of chickpea under field conditions. Among the 19 isolates of actinobacteria tested, significant (p < 0.05) increase of minerals over the uninoculated control treatments was noticed on all the isolates for Fe (10–38 %), 17 for Zn (13–30 %), 16 for Ca (14–26 %), 9 for Cu (11–54 %) and 10 for Mn (18–35 %) and Mg (14–21 %). The increase might be due to the production of siderophore-producing capacity of the tested actinobacteria, which was confirmed in our previous studies by q-RT PCR on siderophore genes expressing up to 1.4- to 25-fold increased relative transcription levels. The chickpea seeds were subjected to processing to increase the mineral availability during consumption. The processed seeds were found to meet the recommended daily intake of FDA by 24–28 % for Fe, 25–28 % for Zn, 28–35 % for Cu, 12–14 % for Ca, 160–167 % for Mn and 34–37 % for Mg. It is suggested that the microbial inoculum can serve as a complementary sustainable tool for the existing biofortification strategies and substantially reduce the chemical fertilizer inputs.



Introduction

According to the global hunger index 2014, there are two billion people suffering from hidden hunger, also called micronutrient deficiency (von Grebmer et al. 2014). Among the micronutrient deficiencies, mineral deficiency has higher prevalence than vitamin deficiency as it holds various facets such as high impact for iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and iodine (I) (WHO 2002); less impact for calcium (Ca) and selenium (Se) (WHO 2004); and impact at sub-populations or at regional levels for magnesium (Mg) and copper (Cu) (White and Broadley 2009). Among these important minerals, Fe and Zn deficiencies are prevalent and ranked 9th and 11th, among the 20 leading health risks, respectively. Intensive agricultural farming systems are part of the root causes of mineral deficiencies, as the success of the modern agriculture by continuous use of high-yielding cultivars make the soils deficient in their native nutrients (Graham et al. 2007; Fan et al. 2008). Indian soil status also supports these observations through available reports on the differences in total vs. available soil minerals: 4000–273,000 vs. 0.36–174 mg kg−1 for Fe and 7–2960 vs. 0.1–24.6 mg kg−1 for Zn (Gupta 2005; Singh 2009).

Biofortification, a process by which crops are bred in a way that increases their nutritional value especially minerals and vitamins, can tackle the hidden hunger as it merely targets staple foods that people eat every day. The currently available strategies for biofortification are agronomic biofortification, conventional plant breeding and genetic engineering. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis on these strategies identified that mineral availability in the soil is a common weakness (Carvalho and Vasconcelos 2013). Previous reports have also stated that the key barrier to micronutrient absorption in plants occurs in the root–soil interface (Welch 2001). This can be tackled by the use of microbial inoculum(s), as microbes are well known as invisible engineers of soil health and the central core for various biogeochemical cycles, besides their habitat in rhizosphere or bulk soil (Gadd 2010). Among them, plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacteria are either rhizospheric or endophytic and influence plant growth through multiple PGP traits such as nitrogen fixation, production of growth hormones, siderophores and solubilization of Zn, P and K, which are of great importance (Bhattacharyya and Jha 2012). Currently, few reports are available for such PGP microbial communities involving genera such as Bacillus, Providencia, Brevundimonas, Ochrobactrum, Azotobacter and Anabaena in enhancing the mineral density of wheat, rice, maize and chickpea (Rana et al. 2012a, b, 2015; Khalid et al. 2015; Prasanna et al. 2015). However, there are no reports on PGP actinobacteria. With the above background information, we evaluated chickpea seed mineral content which was tested for the PGP effects of a set of PGP actinobacteria under field conditions during 2013–2014.
