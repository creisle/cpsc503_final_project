
Abstract

In this review, a comprehensive discussion exclusively on bacterial xylanases; their gene organization; different factors and conditions affecting enzyme yield and activity; and their commercial application have been deliberated in the light of recent research findings and extensive information mining. Improved understanding of biological properties and genetics of bacterial xylanase will enable exploitation of these enzymes for many more ingenious biotechnological and industrial applications.
