To improve biodegradability (% biodegradation) and specific growth rate of Rhodococcus pyridinivorans NT2, culture medium and environmental parameters were screened and optimized using the statistical design techniques of Plackett–Burman and response surface methodology. Of the process variables screened, DNTs (2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT), MgSO4·7H2O, temperature and inoculum size (O.D.) were selected as the most important (P value <0.05) factors. In multiresponse analysis of central composite design, medium formulation consisting of 474/470 mg l−1 2,4-DNT/2,6-DNT, 0.11 g l−1 MgSO4·7H2O, 37.5 °C temperature and 1.05 OD inoculum size were found to predict maximum % degradation and specific growth rate of 97.55 % and 0.19 h−1, respectively. The validity of the optimized variables was verified in shake flasks. The optimized media significantly shortened the time required for biodegradation of DNTs while providing a nearly 30 % (for 2,4-DNT) and 70 % (for 2,6-DNT) increased biodegradation along with 5.64-fold increase in specific growth rate for both DNTs.
