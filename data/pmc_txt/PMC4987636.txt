Amylases are of great significance for biotechnological and industrial applications and have approximately 25 % of the world enzyme market (Reddy et al. 2003). Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase is one of the important members of the α-amylase family 13 of glycosyl hydrolases which can degrade starch. This family of enzymes exhibits diversity in reaction specificities. Amylases generally hydrolyze glycosidic bonds in the starch molecules, but CGTases catalyze transglycosylation as a major reaction with hydrolysis being a minor activity (Van der Veen et al. 2000).

CGTases produce cyclodextrins (CDs) as a result of intramolecular transglycosylation (cyclization) reaction during the degradation of starch. Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides commonly composed of six, seven or eight d-glucose units (α, β and γ-cyclodextrins, respectively) joined by α- glycosidic bonds (Szejtli 1998). Because of this unique property, CDs can form molecular inclusion complexes (host–guest complexes) with a wide range of solid, liquid and gaseous compounds and hence affect the stability, solubility, reactivity and bioavailability of a wide range of molecules. So, cyclodextrins have various applications in the field of medicine, food, pharmaceutical, analytical chemistry, agriculture and cosmetics (Hedges 1998). Though CDs have several possible industrial uses, their extensive applications are restricted due to their high prices and low yields (Singh et al. 2002). Hence, screening of novel sources for CGTases has a wide technical and practical impact on the enzymatic production of CDs (Biwer et al. 2002).

The bacillus group of bacteria, e.g., Bacillus coagulans (Akimaru et al. 1991), Bacillus firmus (Goel and Nene 1995), Bacillus agaradhaerens (Martins and Hatti-Kaul 2000), Bacillus lentus (Sabioni and Park 1992), Bacillus ohbensis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus macerans (Yagi et al. 1986), Bacillus alcalophilus B-3101 (Abelyan et al. 2002) and Bacillus pseudalcaliphilus 20RF (Atanasovva et al. 2011) have been mainly reported for CGTase production. Apart from the Bacillus group, there are reports of CGTase production from other organisms like Klebsiella pneumoniae AS-22 (Gawande and Patkar 2001), Brevibacterium sp. 9605 (Mori et al. 1994), Paenibacillus campinasensis H69-3 (Alves-Prado et al. 2007), Paenibacillus illinoisensis ZY-08 (Lee et al. 2013) Pyrococcus furiosus DSM3638 (Lee et al. 2007), Thermococcus (Tachibana et al. 1999) and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris Tac-5354 (Abelyan et al. 2002). There are also reports of CGTase producing anaerobic bacteria like Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes EM1 (Wind et al. 1995) and Anaerobranca gottschalkii (Thiemann et al. 2004). Bautista et al. reported the CGTase from halophilic archeon Haloferax mediterranei. Though CGTase production and characterization from a variety of aerobic mesophilic bacteria have been reported, there is a need of robust enzymes from other organisms considering the harsh conditions used in starch industries (Wind et al. 1995).

There are many reports on the purification of CGTases using different procedures like ultrafiltration, gel filtration, starch adsorption chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. We have isolated a new alkaliphile Microbacterium terrae KNR 9 for CGTase production (Rajput et al. 2016). In this study, we report the purification and properties of CGTase produced by Mic. terrae KNR 9.
