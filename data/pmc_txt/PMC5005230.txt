
Abstract

Tandem affinity purification (TAP) is a highly efficient method for isolation of protein complexes from endogenous biological macromolecules. TAP system consists of dual affinity tags that facilitates the sequential purification of the desired proteins expressed at their low levels in vivo. Polo-like kinases (PLK) are serine/threonine protein kinases that are the crucial regulators of cell cycle. Cdc5, the solitary PLK in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has diverse array of targets in cell cycle. The present study was undertaken to construct an estrogen-inducible system for expression of Cdc5-TAP to isolate the substrates of Cdc5 during meiosis, particularly, pachytene stage of meiosis I. Two yeast strains were constructed CDC5-IN (ndt80∆ pGAL1-CDC5-TAP) and Cdc5-kinase inactive mutant (ndt80∆ pGAL1-cdc5-N209A-TAP). The estrogen-inducible expression of Cdc5-TAP and cdc5-N209A-TAP was validated by Western analysis. The systems would serve as a valuable tool for purification of substrates binding to Cdc5-TAP by TAP affinity chromatography.

Introduction

Polo-like kinases are serine threonine kinases characterized by the presence of protein kinase domain at the N-terminus, and a polo box domain (PBD) at the C-terminus, the latter playing a role in the modulation of kinase activity and substrate recognition (Lee et al. 2005). PLKs spatiotemporally regulate and coordinate mitosis and meiosis. A single PLK exists in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Cdc5), while multiple PLKs have been identified in other organisms, except plants (Vaid et al. 2016). In S. cerevisiae, Cdc5, the solitary PLK regulates G2/M phase transition, metaphase to anaphase transition during mitosis, exit from mitosis and cytokinesis (Nigg 1998; Lee et al. 2005; Vaid et al. 2016). In eukaryotic systems, meiosis is imperative for genetic diversity and meiotic recombination. During meiosis, bi-phasic division takes place, wherein during the reductional division (meiosis I) homologous chromosomes segregate followed by equational division (meiosis II) producing four haploid gametes (Hochwagen and Amon 2006; Simchen 2009; Börner and Cha 2015). Cdc5 is a central regulator of meiosis I in S. cerevisiae (Attner et al. 2013; Vaid et al. 2016). Cdc5 regulates the meiotic functions in prophase I, including exit from pachytene, mono-orientation of the sister kinetochores, removal of cohesins from chromosomal arms at metaphase I and anaphase I, respectively, followed by meiotic divisions (Sharon and Simchen 1990; Clyne et al. 2003; Lee and Amon 2003a, b; Vaid et al. 2016). In S. cerevisiae, a meiosis-specific transcription factor, Ndt80, is essential for meiotic progression (Chu and Herskowitz 1998). Cells lacking Ndt80 arrest at pachytene and fail to complete meiotic divisions (Benjamin et al. 2003). During meiosis, transcription of CDC5 is activated by Ndt80. Similar to Ndt80, Cdc5 has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for pachytene exit in meiosis I, raising the possibility of some targets of Cdc5 to be required for pachytene exit (Clyne et al. 2003; Lee and Amon 2003a, b; Sourirajan and Lichten 2008). However, the downstream targets of Cdc5 in pachytene exit have not been deciphered. Some of the targets of Cdc5 have been already identified, like Rec8, Mam1, and Ime2, none of which has a role in pachytene exit (Clyne et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2008; Sourirajan and Lichten 2008; Attner et al. 2013). There is still an array of unexplored targets, whose discovery could provide an insight into the role of Cdc5 in pachytene exit in specific, and meiosis as a whole.

The present study was initiated to develop an amenable tool for identification of the substrates of the PLK, Cdc5 during yeast meiosis. An estrogen-inducible system for Cdc5 expression during specific phase in meiosis was generated as described in previous studies (Benjamin et al. 2003; Sourirajan and Lichten 2008). The inducible system was combined with the TAP-tagging of Cdc5 to identify the targets of Cdc5 during yeast meiosis (Puig et al. 2001). The system was functionally validated by Western analysis.

Tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag is an affinity chromatography-based rapid and generic system of protein purification, which is further analyzed with mass spectrometry to identify the protein ensembles that are part of any functional proteome (Rigaut et al. 1999; Puig et al. 2001; Xu et al. 2010). The scope of TAP method in yeast allows the purification of TAP-tagged protein and its associated components using dual affinity system (Rigaut et al. 1999). The C-terminal TAP insertion cassette consists of two domains, proximally a calmodulin-binding peptide, a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (Dougherty et al. 1989; Kapust et al. 2001) in the center and an IgG binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A at the distal end (Uhlen et al. 1983; Puig et al. 2001). The desired protein with C-terminal TAP tag is sequentially purified under mild conditions on IgG matrix followed by the elution with TEV protease, and then passed through the calmodulin resin in the presence of Ca2+ ions and finally eluting the protein of interest in presence of ethylene glycol tetra acetic acid (EGTA) (Puig et al. 2001; Van Driessche et al. 2005).
