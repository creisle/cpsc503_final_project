Chlorophenols are regarded as a serious menace to the environment due to their widespread occurrence and toxicity to human and other flora and fauna (Olaniran and Igbinosa 2011; Snyder et al. 2006). The primary sources of MCPs are the chlorination of drinking water and wastewater, degradation of chloride containing pesticides and higher chlorophenols (ATSDR 1999). Other sources of MCPs and DCPs contamination are an industrial discharge of pulp and paper, dye, leather and tanning industries (Olaniran and Igbinosa 2011; Marihal et al. 2009; Field and Sierra-Alvarez 2008; Wang et al. 2014). Chlorophenols have a detrimental effect on the environment due to their physicochemical properties, which results in higher persistence and subsequent bioaccumulation (Olaniran and Igbinosa 2011; Marihal et al. 2009). They have been classified as a priority pollutant by the US Environmental Protection Agency (ATSDR 2015). Different physicochemical treatments such as oxidation, solvent extraction, photodegradation, and adsorption are only transforming the compounds from one phase to another. High cost, toxic by-product yield, low energy efficiency limits the employment of physicochemical methods (Herrera et al. 2008; Olaniran and Igbinosa 2011). On the contrary, biological treatment is a potential substitute with promising removal efficiency and complete mineralization of the chlorophenols. It is an eco-friendly and energy-efficient treatment with assuring future (Field and Sierra-Alvarez 2008; Karigar and Rao 2011).

There exist various reports on biodegradation of chlorophenols using pure as well as mixed microorganisms (Baggi et al. 2002; Nordin et al. 2005; El-Sayed et al. 2009; Solyanikova and Golovleva 2004; Farrell and Quilty 1999; Patel and Kumar 2016b). A cleavage of aromatic ring and removal of chloride ions are two important steps necessary for complete mineralization of chlorophenol compounds (Häggblom 1990). Aerobic biodegradation of MCPs mainly follows two pathways, ortho- and meta-fission. The first step in the biodegradation of MCPs is their transformation into chlorocatechol (CC). 2-Chlorophenol (2-CP) and 3-chlorophenol (3-CP) are being converted to 3-chlorocatechol (3-CC) while, 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) is converted to 4-chlorocatechol (4-CC) (Arora and Bae 2014; Häggblom 1990). The second step is the ring cleavage of chlorocatechol by dioxygenases. The aromatic ring cleavage of CC occurs via either ortho- or meta-pathway (Veenagayathri and Vasudevan 2011). Chloroaromatic compounds degraded via ortho-pathway catalyzed by enzyme catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (Farrell and Quilty 1999). While the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase are responsible for the meta-cleavage of CC. The meta-cleavage of 3-CC results in the dead-end pathway due to the generation of suicide or dead-end metabolites (Schmidt et al. 1983; Bartels et al. 1984; Klecka and Gibson 1981). The meta-cleavage of 4-CC results in the production of 5-chloro-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (5-CHMS) which has been reported as dead-end metabolite (Wieser et al. 1994; Arora and Bae 2014). But recent studies have shown the further degradation of 5-CHMS, indicating complete degradation of 4-CP via meta-fission pathway (Westmeier and Rehm 1987; Farrell and Quilty 1999; El-Sayed et al. 2009).

Co-metabolism of chlorophenols is important in understanding the in situ bioremediation, synergetic of the biodegradation and multi-substrate degradation process that has been encountered in the environment. Carbon and nitrogen sources such as glucose, sodium acetate, peptone, yeast extract were reported to enhance the biodegradation of chlorophenols (Murialdo et al. 2003; Shen et al. 2005; Sahinkaya and Dilek 2006a, b; Patel and Kumar 2016a). However, this would increase the cost of the treatment. Other studies recommended the use of lower toxic compounds such as lower phenolic compounds for increased degradation of higher toxic compounds (Wang et al. 2014; Durruty et al. 2011; Tobajas et al. 2012; De Los Cobos-Vasconcelos et al. 2006). The degradation of higher toxic recalcitrant compounds has been found to increase in the presence of lower toxic compounds due to their structural similarity, increased biomass growth and enzymes induced by lower toxic compounds facilitate the degradation of higher toxic compounds (Durruty et al. 2011; Alexander 1999). However, converse effects were also reported in the literature.

In the present study, the biodegradation of three monochlorophenols (2-CP, 3-CP, and 4-CP) by the defined mixed microbial consortium was studied. The effects of initial substrate concentration, biodegradation kinetic and intermediate metabolites were studied. In addition, the multi-substrate degradation by defined mixed consortium was analyzed to study the effect of the presence of three MCPs on the biodegradation of 2,4-DCP in the various combination.
