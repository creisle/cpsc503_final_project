
Abstract

Oil spillage sites primarily contain various types of hydrocarbons, such as linear chain, polycyclic, and aromatic compounds, posing several detrimental effects on plants. Results from our previous study showed an alteration of various metabolomic parameters, indirectly resulting in an observable decline of growth in the mung seedlings upon incubation with phenol, toluene, xylene, and hexane. This study evaluates the role of these compounds upon plant growth and focusses to mitigate the effect of the same, using some isolated plant synergistic bacteria. We isolated Proteus sp., Streptococcus sp., and Enterococcus sp., and tested the synergism of them in mung seedlings (Vigna radiata) by hydroponics. Treatment with the above-mentioned compounds significantly reduced the root and shoot length of the seedlings when compared to the control. The bacterial treatment helped in reducing the adversity due to the xenobiotic insult, by improving the root shoot length of the treated seedlings. Proteus sp. was found to be the most promising among other isolates. In another experiment, plasmid profiling of the bacterial isolates was done, yielding a band of 4.5 kb common for all, serving as a clue to be the most probable plasmid responsible for the degradation of the compounds. Results from this study clearly indicate that Proteus sp. can be explored further for its plant synergism and xenobiotic degradative capability to exploit its potential in oil spillage land reclamation and establishing vegetation.



Introduction

The sustainability of population in any part of the world is primarily due to the vegetation it possesses. There are various factors that determine the type of agriculture being done, soil profile being the most important one. Over the years, shifting toward the use of chemical pesticides not only affected the food chain but also upon the soil quality, such as reduced nutrients, water retention capacity. However, certain types of man-made disasters such as petroleum oil spillage create havoc and disrupt the entire agricultural belt along that area. Oil spillage land or petroleum polluted soil mainly contains various polycyclic, linear, and aromatic compounds that hamper the growth of the plants (Wyszkowski and Ziólkowska 2013). In certain cases, it renders the land of no use. Degradation of the hydrocarbons and nutrient cycling can establish vegetation again. In the line of these attempts, people are trying to exploit the potential of soil microbes possessing degradation capabilities of hydrocarbons (Peng et al. 2015). Phenol, toluene, xylene, and hexane are a few hydrocarbons usually present in the spillage sites. Recently, we showed that incubating mung seedlings with these compounds proved to be highly toxic in the case of phenol, followed by hexane, xylene and toluene. Various metabolomic parameters, such as total protein content, total soluble sugar, total reducing sugar, and total phenolic contents, significantly reduced at increasing concentration of the compounds (Gupta and De 2015). In this study, treated mung seedlings with phenol, toluene, xylene, and hexane showed significant reduction in root shoot length as compared to the control group. To counter this effect, isolated bacterial culture was inoculated in the medium, for the degradation of the compound and rendering the seedlings to grow, showing an enhancement of the root shoot length as compared with the treated groups. Proteus sp. was found to be the most promising among them. To understand the degradative potential of the bacterial isolates, plasmid profiling was done, yielding a band of nearly 4.5-kb common for all the isolates, serving as a clue to be the most probable plasmid involved in degradation of those compounds. The results from this study clearly indicate that Proteus sp. can be explored further in the future for its degradative capability and plant synergism.



Discussion

Any form of stress to plants is usually reflected by its alteration in the growth profile, changes in gene expression and metabolomic parameters (Gupta and De 2015). Oil spillage or fuel oil contamination in any area increases the toxic hydrocarbon loads on the soil, which in turn affects the agriculture and vegetation. The hydrocarbons and xenobiotics takes years to degrade, so the process is usually speeded up by bioremediation processes such as using bacteria that can degrade those toxic compounds. For example, Proteus sp. can grow on hexane, toluene and able to degrade benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) from heavily sites. Streptococcus sp. can also degrade phenol from oil contaminated soil (Mohite et al. 2010). Enterococcus sp. can grow on hexane, xylene, and degrade azodyes released through textile industry effluent (Mate and Pathade 2012). However, to use the bacterial isolates, we need to test the synergism of them with the plants, so both can coexist together. Results from this study confirm that the bacterial isolates were very well synergistic with the seedlings, and Proteus sp. was the best among them. The hydrocarbons degradative potential of any bacteria is mainly attributed to its plasmids present which carries genes for the degradation, for example, Pseudomonas sp. possess XYL plasmid that can degrade xylene (Friello et al. 1976). A common molecular weight of 4.5 kb plasmid suggests that it can be the most probable plasmid involved in the degradation of the compounds. To confirm the synergism of bacteria with plant, there must be some enhancement in the growth profile of the stressed plant compared to the normal one. The enhancement in the root shoot length of the seedlings in presence of Proteus sp. is statistically significant compared to the control, which suggest it to be an excellent candidate for use, to deal with oil spillage or fuel contaminated soil and restore the vegetation.
