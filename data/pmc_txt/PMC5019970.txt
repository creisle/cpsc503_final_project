Pitting corrosion due to microbial activity is the most severe type of corrosion that occurs in ship hull. Since biogenic sulfide produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is involved in the acceleration of pitting corrosion of marine vessels, so it is important to collect information about SRB community involved in maritime vessel failure. We investigated the SRB community on corroded hull portion of the ship. With the use of common cultural method and 16S rDNA sequencing, ten bacteria with sulfate reduction ability were isolated and identified. They belonged to both traditional (Desulfovibrio, Desulfotomaculum) and non-traditional (Citrobacter) sulfate-reducing bacteria. All the isolates were able to produce a high amount of sulfide. However, only traditional isolates were showing the amplification for the SRB-specific gene, dsrAB. Further studies on corrosion potential of these two groups of bacteria showed that in spite of high sulfide and biofilm production by non-traditional SRB, they are less aggressive towards the mild steel compare to the traditional group.



Introduction

Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is an electrochemical process, where the presence and activity of microorganisms accelerate the kinetics of corrosion process (Beech and Sunner 2004). MIC is well documented in many industries, including ship industry, offshore oil and gas production, power plants, and coastal industrial plants (Licina and Cubicciotti 1989; Bodtker et al. 2008; Inbakandan et al. 2010).

Maritime vessels are prone to MIC, as they continuously get exposed to seawater which contains a large number of different microbes. The impairment of metal function due to microbial bioactivity leads to substantial economical loss for ship industries (Schultz et al. 2011). The corrosion of ship hulls increases the surface roughness which consequently enhances the frictional drag. This reduces the ship speed which could be compensated by higher fuel consumption to maintain the required speed. Currently, antifouling paint (paints containing biocides) is being employed to prevent microbial corrosion on ship (Almeida et al. 2007). However, the effective action of antifouling paint depends on many factors, such as temperature, salinity and acidity of water, type of metal, and type of microorganism.

Microbial community on ship hull consists of rich and functionally diverse group of bacteria (Inbakandan et al. 2010). Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi, and yeast are reported to be responsible for the corrosion of ship hull (Wade et al. 2011). Though many bacteria have been isolated from ship hull, information regarding sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) communities from hull of ship has not been recorded so far.

SRB are the most troublesome groups of microorganisms involved in MIC in shipping industry (Tsinker 2004). Hydrogen sulfide, an end product of SRB metabolism, reacts with metal ion to form less soluble metal sulfide which later gets deposited on the metal surface and accelerates the process of pitting corrosion. Pitting corrosion reduces hull thickness which consequently affects the strength performance of the hull structure and results in other forms of failures (Jakubowski 2011). Therefore, due to the importance of this group of bacteria in MIC, in the present study, an attempt was made to isolate the sulfate-reducing bacteria from the biofilm formed on the corroded ship hull.
