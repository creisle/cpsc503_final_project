
Abstract

Mycogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was carried out in the present investigation using an aqueous extract of endophytic non-pathogenic Alternaria solani F10 (KT721914). The mycosynthesized AgNPs were characterized by means of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The surface plasmon resonance found at 430 nm confirmed the formation of stable AgNPs for several weeks at room temperature. Also, the results revealed the formation of spherical and monodispersed AgNPs with an average size of 14.8 ± 1.2 nm. The FT-IR spectrum suggested that the fungal extracellular proteins and secondary metabolites had the role in Ag reduction and AgNPs capping of which protein Ag nanoconjugates were formed. Furthermore, the mycosynthesized AgNPs exhibited potent antifungal activity against different pathogenic isolates of the same Alternaria solani fungus, the causal pathogen of tomato early blight disease. The antifungal efficiency of the AgNPs at 1, 5 and 10 ppm were evaluated for 8 days after incubation by measuring the inhibition rate of fungal radial growth. The results were further supported by investigating fungal hyphae morphology alteration by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Treated fungal hyphae showed formation of pits and pores. Also, the mycosynthesized AgNPs were able to pass and distribute throughout the fungal cell area and interact with the cell components.



Introduction

Nano-biotechnology has emerged as one of the fastest growing areas of research in modern materials science and technology (Thakkar et al. 2010). Synthesis of nanoparticles has generated much interest in academia, as well as industry, because it bridges the gap between bulk materials and atomic molecular structures (Moradi et al. 2013). Owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly being applied in a variety of fields, including optics, electronics, mechanics, catalysis, energy science, medicine and agricultural technology (Ensafi and Karimi-Maleh 2010; Elyasi et al. 2013; Sadeghi et al. 2013). AgNPs are known to exhibit a broad spectrum of biocidal activity towards many bacteria, fungi and viruses (Zachariadis et al. 2004; Kumar and Sujitha 2014; Abd-Alla et al. 2016; Netala et al. 2016). From a therapeutic perspective, AgNPs are finding their way as antimicrobial (Kim et al. 2009a), anti-inflammatory (Nadworny et al. 2008), anti-angiogenic (Gurunathan et al. 2009) and antiviral (Rogers et al. 2008) agents. Although chemical and physical methods have allowed successful production of well-defined AgNPs, they are usually costly and involve the use of toxic reducing and capping reagents (Qin et al. 2010). In contrast, biological synthesis of AgNPs is a promising strategy that relies on natural products obtained from fungi, bacteria, algae, viruses, or plants (Narayanan and Sakthivel 2010; Das et al. 2014; Kagithoju et al. 2015; Netala et al. 2016). Fungi are one of the best options to produce AgNPs, due to the vast repertoire of proteins, enzymes, and other bioactive secondary metabolites that they produce and possess redox activity (Birla et al. 2009; Metuku et al. 2014).

More specifically, fungal endophytes have been recognized as important sources of a wide variety of structurally unique, bioactive natural products, which offer an enormous potential in medical, agricultural and industrial uses (Zhang et al. 2007). However, up to date, very few studies have investigated the biological synthesis of AgNPs using fungal endophytes (Tanvir et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013).

Alternaria solani (Ellis & Martin) Jones & Grout is a soil inhabiting, air-borne fungal pathogen responsible of tomato leaf blight, and collar and fruit rot (Datar and Mayee 1981). It causes reduction in crop quantity and quality. Current strategies to control early blight disease consist of preventing wetness on leaf surface during long periods of time, development of host plant resistance and application of fungicides. Synthetic chemical fungicides are widely used in conventional agriculture to control plant diseases. Different chemical fungicides including Ridomil gold plus, Mancozeb, copper oxychloride, carbendazim, captafol and benomyl have been used today to control tomato early blight caused by A. solani (Chohan et al. 2015; Saharan et al. 2015). However, environmental toxic hazards caused by excessive use of those fungicides pose health problems as modern society is becoming more conscious (Kim et al. 2009b). In addition, pathogens can derive resistance against fungicides (Namanda et al. 2004; Kirk et al. 2005). Also, pathogen populations that develop resistance to one fungicide may automatically and simultaneously become resistant to other related fungicides. Therefore, scientists in the agricultural field are searching for alternative eco-friendly and less capital intensive approaches to control plant diseases and crop protection. Nanoparticles may act upon pathogens in a way similar to chemical pesticides. Nanomaterials can also be used as carriers of active ingredients of pesticides to the target pathogens (Khan and Rizvi 2014). Biologically synthesized AgNPs in different formulations and with different shapes and sizes should rely on products for controlling various plant fungal pathogens in a relatively safer way compared to synthetic fungicides.

In the present study, we report the production of AgNPs using extracts from an endophytic non-pathogenic isolate of Alternaria solani. The mycosynthesis process was carried out under ambient conditions, without the addition of any external chemical reducing agent. We also report the antifungal activity of the mycosynthesized AgNPs compared to the chemical fungicide (Ridomil gold plus) against different pathogenic isolates of the same fungus Alternaria solani. Finally, we also study the possible action mechanisms of the mycosynthesized AgNPs.
