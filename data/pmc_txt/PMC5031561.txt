Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are a class of compounds widely used as plasticizers to provide mechanical strength and flexibility to the resins (Cartwright et al. 2000; Staples et al. 1997). They are ingredients of paints, adhesives, house-building materials, defoaming agents, PVC pipes, food packing materials, toys, plastics, solubilizers of cosmetic products, medical devices, photography films, textile fabrics, pesticide carriers, lubricating oils and are used in aerospace technology (Gesler 1973; Gross and Colony 1973; Hauser et al. 2007; Ito et al. 2005; Krauskopf 1973; Marcel 1973; Teil et al. 2006; Tepper 1973; Wang et al. 1995b; Wilkinson and Lamb 1999). They have low solubility in water; therefore, they are stable in the environment over a longer period of time (Huang et al. 2008; Vikelsøe et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2008; Yuan et al. 2002). They have been detected in various environments including landfill leachates (Schwarzbauer et al. 2002; Zheng et al. 2007), air (Wensing et al. 2005), soils, sediments, and natural waters (Staples et al. 1997). PAEs have been classified as top priority toxicants by the European Union, China National Environmental Monitoring Center and US Environment Protection Agency (Chen et al. 2007; Council of the European Union 1993). PAEs are responsible for carcinogenicity and endocrine disruption (Colborn et al. 1993; David et al. 1999; Jobling et al. 1995; Piersma et al. 2000). They can elicit cellular estrogenic responses and suppress calcium signaling (Kaun-Yu et al. 2004; Lovekamp-Swan and Davis 2003; Moore 2000). They are responsible for hypospadias, cryptorchidism and malformation of the reproductive tract in mice (Fisher 2004; Gray et al. 2000; Jaeger and Rubin 1970; Li et al. 1998; Zhu et al. 2006). They are known for irritation of eyes, skin, respiratory tract, blurred vision and induce stone formation in the bladder (Dai et al. 2005a, b; Wang and Gu 2006). Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is the most widely used plasticizer and has been detected in different environments (Eaton 2001; Feiler 1980; Hashizume et al. 2002; Keith and Telliard 1979; Xu et al. 2005).

The natural processes of degradation such as hydrolysis and photodecomposition are not efficient in the degradation of these pollutants (Lu et al. 2009). Therefore, microbial degradation is the major route for their degradation (Staples et al. 1997; Vamsee-Krishna et al. 2006; Vamsee-Krishna and Phale 2008). Bacteria having potential to degrade PAEs have been isolated from various environments including mangrove sediments, activated sludge and wastewater (Liang et al. 2008). Aerobic degradation of PAEs is much more efficient as compared to anaerobic degradation (Cheung et al. 2007; Fang et al. 2010). Sequential hydrolysis of PAEs has been demonstrated by a few researchers (Engelhardt and Wallnöfer 1978; Jiao et al. 2013; Staples et al. 1997).

Despite research on degradation of PAEs by various researchers, these studies lack in perspectives such as efficient DBP degradation at higher concentrations, elucidation of DBP degradation pathway, kinetics of DBP degradation and identification of genes responsible for PAEs degradation. Extensive research in the above aspects is required to remove these pollutants from the environment. The aim of the study was isolation, characterization and identification of efficient DBP-degrading bacterial strain from municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate and to examine the degradation potential of the isolate toward degradation of DBP in both minimal media and in PAEs-contaminated samples collected from the landfill site.
