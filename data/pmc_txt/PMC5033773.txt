
Abstract

Polygalacturonases represents an important member of pectinases group of enzymes with diverse industrial applications and is widely distributed among fungi, bacteria, yeasts, plants and some plant parasitic nematodes. An endo-polygalacturonase from a new fungal source Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC 2584 was produced under solid-state fermentation conditions and was purified simply by acetone precipitation and gel-filtration chromatography technique. The approximate molecular weight of the purified PG was found to be 43.0 kDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE. The pH optimum of the purified enzyme was found to be 10.0 and was stable in the pH range of 7–10. The optimum temperature of purified PG was found to be 30 °C. The Km and Kcat of the purified enzyme were 2.4 mg/ml and 44 s−1, respectively, and the metal ions Cu2+ and K+ were found to enhance the enzyme activity while Ag+, Ca2+ and Hg2+ were inhibitory in nature. Based on its alkaline nature, the potential of purified PG in retting of natural fiber Crotalaria juncea was elucidated in the absence of EDTA. This is probably the first report of alkaline PG from Aspergillus fumigatus.



Introduction

Polygalacturonases (PGs) (EC 3.2.1.15) are important member of pectinases which catalyze the hydrolysis of α-1,4-D-galacturonic acid linkages in smooth region of pectin. Depending on their mode of hydrolysis of the substrate, PGs are classified as endo-PGs (E.C. 3.2.1.15) and exo-PGs (EC 3.2.1.67). The endo-PGs cleave the α-1,4-D-galacturonic acid linkages randomly, whereas exo-PGs cleave the linkage from non-reducing end (Anand et al. 2014). Endo-PGs are generally found in extracellular environment and exo-PGs in the periplasm. This localization is in coherence with the substrate accumulation in each environment, endo-PG would degrade extracellular polymerized forms of pectin present within the plant cell wall and exo-PGs would produce small oligogalacturonides and monogalacturonic acid from pectic fragments that accumulate in periplasm for intracellular transport (Abbott and Boraston 2008).

Polygalacturonases are widely distributed among fungi, bacteria, yeasts, plants and some plant parasitic nematodes (Niture 2008). The genera Aspergillus is an important source of PGs. Several endo-PGs and exo-PGs have been purified and characterized from different species of Aspergillus like Aspergillus niger (Parenicova et al. 1998; Zhou et al. 2015), A. awamori (Nagai et al. 2000), A. carbonarius (Nakkeeran et al. 2011), A. tubingensis (Kester et al. 1996), A. niger (Sakamoto et al. 2002), A. sojae (Dogan and Tari 2008) and Aspergillus sojae (Buyukkileci et al. 2014).

PGs being of great industrial importance, knowledge of their biochemical properties is essential for their utilization in relevant industries. The pH optima of purified PGs determines its possible application like fruit juice clarification, retting of natural fibers etc. It has been observed that most of the fungal PGs have pH optima 3–6 (Patil et al. 2012; Yadav et al. 2012; Kant et al. 2013; Martins et al. 2013; Castruita-Domínguez et al. 2014; Ortega et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2015; Zaslona and Trusek-Holownia 2015; Pan et al. 2015).

Most of the fungal PGs show temperature optima between 35 and 60 °C, though few thermophilic fungal strains like Aspergillus sojae, Paecilomyces variotii, Thermoascus aurantiacus with temperature optima in the range of 60–70 °C have been reported (Dogan and Tari 2008; de Lima Damasio et al. 2010; Martins et al. 2007, 2013).

Alkaline polygalacturonases have been reported from bacterial strains, Bacillus in particular (Kobayashi et al. 2001), and alkaline PG having application in retting of natural fibers is a rare finding. Keeping the above points in view, authors have reported purification and characterization of an alkaline PG from fungal strain Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC 2584 under solid-state fermentation conditions and elucidated its application in retting of Crotalaria juncea fibers. Thus, it could be a potential enzyme for textile or paper industries.
