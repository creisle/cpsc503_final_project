The isolation of good quality metagenomic DNA from diverse soil, in appreciable amount, is a prerequisite for metagenomics. The availability of commercial kits for isolation of genomic DNAs from soil has drastically expedited the application of metagenomics approach for identifying novel sources of industrially important enzymes. The quantitative and qualitative assessment of metagenomic DNA isolated using either the manual method or the kit-based method should be performed prior to its use in downstream applications. The metagenomic DNA isolated from six different soil samples, using three methods, were analyzed in terms of yield, quality and downstream application as template for PCR amplification. The yield of DNA was approximately 3.52, 7.35, and 232.42 μg of DNA per gram of soil sample for the kit-based method, kit-modified method, and manual method, respectively. The manual method seems to be promising based on better yield and lesser humic acid content than the other two methods. The maximum yield was obtained in the soil collected from teak forest with all the three methods, indicating maximum microbial content and diversity. Furthermore, in terms of its suitability as template DNA for PCR amplification using 16S RNA primer, all methods are equally well. Thus, comparative assessment of three methods revealed suitability of manual method based on DNA yield and humic acid content, which could be important for many downstream applications like library preparations during metageomics approach.



Introduction

Soil comprises of complex biological ecosystem containing wide plethora of microbial entities. The microbial population is known to be a vast reservoir of numerous biomolecules, biocatalysts, antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance genes (Daniel 2005; Riesenfeld et al. 2004; Simon and Daniel 2011). The immense biological treasure stored in the ecosystem either in soil, water, and air needs to be explored. Researchers have attempted to explore this rich ecosystem by culturing the microbial strains under laboratory conditions but this account for less 1 % of the total microbial diversity (Handelsman 2004). In order to assess the remaining microbial diversity, ‘metagenomics’ is the only alternative and has been extensively reviewed over the years (Fernandez-Arrojo et al. 2010; Schmeisser et al. 2007; Steele et al. 2009; Uchiyama and Miyazaki 2009). Metagenomic involves analysis of DNA from diverse soil, marine, and airborne habitats. DNA extracted from the microbial communities is cloned in the hosts which can be easily cultured in laboratory conditions (Handelsman 2004). The library is then screened for the desired biomolecules.

The isolation of metagenomic DNA from soil is an important consideration and needs standardization. Since soil is rich in organic matter like humic acid and other inhibitory substances, which hinder downstream applications like PCR amplification and cloning, several protocols have been reported in literature (Berthelet et al. 1996; Gutiérrez-Lucas et al. 2014; Nair et al. 2014; Picard et al. 1992).

The study is primarily focused on the assessment of methods for the isolation of metagenomic DNA from different soil samples, for identifying novel sources of industrially important enzymes of pectinases group, especially pectin lyases (Yadav et al. 2009). Using metagenomic approach, an attempt has been made to access the quantity and quality of soil genomic DNA isolated from different sources using different methods. In this study, a comparative assessment of genomic DNA isolated by the kit-based and manual methods from six different soil samples consisting of different crops is discussed.
