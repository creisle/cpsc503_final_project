Lignocellulose is a complex-structured biomass composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. It cannot be used as carbon source directly and it should be available as fermentable sugar (Bhatia et al. 2015a, 2016; Verma et al. 2016). Various pretreatment methods using acids (such as sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid) or bases (such as ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide) have been reported to improve the accessibility of enzymes to the polysaccharides embedded inside the cell wall and to release free sugars (Laurens et al. 2015; Patel et al. 2012; Verma et al. 2013). Lignocellulose pretreatment using different methods also lead to the release of different inhibitors, i.e., furfural, vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and acetate, which further affects the ability of microbes to utilize free sugar as a carbon source (Allen et al. 2010). Furfural and vanillin are more toxic compounds beyond certain concentration and affect microbial growth (Zhang et al. 2014). A number of approaches have been used to investigate the mechanism of furfural action as this inhibits growth by damaging DNA and chemically reacting with cellular constituents (Akillioglu et al. 2011). Vanillin is one of the most prevalent phenolic compounds found in various lignocellulosic hydrolysates, e.g., from spruce, pine, poplar, corn stover and sugarcane bagasse, and acts as a quorum sensing (QS) blocker (Lv et al. 2014).

Streptomyces coelicolor is a commercially important actinomycete having the potential to produce two chemically distinct pigments as secondary metabolite, i.e., actinorhodin (Act, diffusible blue pigment) and undecylprodigiosin (Red), a cell wall-associated red pigment (Bhatia et al. 2016; Gomez-Escribano and Bibb 2014). The production of antibiotics is regulated by nutrients, growth rate, quorum sensing, transcriptional regulators and other pleiotropic genes (Liu et al. 2013). Regulation is influenced by various low molecular mass compounds, transfer RNA, sigma factors and gene products formed during post-exponential development. These events generate signals which affect a cascade of regulatory events resulting in chemical differentiation (secondary metabolism) and morphological differentiation (morphogenesis). The transcriptional regulation of each antibiotic’s biosynthetic gene cluster depends on a cluster-linked, antibiotic-specific and transcriptional regulator genes. Extensive classical and molecular genetic studies have led to the identification and characterization of numerous developmental genes, the bld and whi, and antibiotic-specific regulators, actII-orf4 for Act and redD for Red (Bush et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2012; Price et al. 1999). Various genes responsible for the physiological controls which operate on pigment production in S. coelicolor are unknown. Molecular biology of antibiotic production is still not understood to a great degree and thus provides an opportunity for further investigation. Most of the research groups have reported that biomass-derived molecules act as an inhibitor, but interestingly in our previous research we found that furfural can elicit antibiotic production in S. coelicolor and it can be used to increase undecylprodigiosin production (Bhatia et al. 2016). Without considering various chemicals exist in biomass hydrolyzate, it is quite risky to use this as a carbon source. In this work, effect of other inhibitory molecules (vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and acetate) on antibiotic production and expression of various regulatory genes were studied.
