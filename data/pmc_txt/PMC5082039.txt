p-Cresol is an environmental pollutant due to its vast use, toxicity and persistence, nevertheless, its degradation in an enzyme is unclear. In this study, we used Pleurotus sp. isolate VLECK02 polyphenol oxidase (PPO) for the determination of p-cresol degradation. On the basis of UV, FT-IR and chromatographic (HPLC and GC–MS) analysis, 4-methylcatechol was identified as the main metabolite of p-cresol catabolism. In addition, batch and semi-continuous degradation of p-cresol (10 and 20 mM) were studied and compared by free and immobilized PPO in different matrices like sodium alginate (SA), sodium alginate–polyvinyl alcohol (SA–PVA) and sodium alginate–polyvinyl alcohol–silver nanoparticles (SA–PVA–AgNPs). The experimental data showed that an enzyme (PPO) immobilized in SA–PVA–AgNPs was completely degraded p-cresol at initial concentrations of 10 and 20 mM within 30 h. These results suggest that the enzyme immobilized in SA–PVA–AgNPs has achieved higher degradation rates at a given time than free PPO and PPO immobilized in SA–PVA and SA. The SA–PVA–AgNPs and SA–PVA immobilized enzyme could be reused for more than 12 and 8 cycles, respectively, without losing any degradation capacity. Moreover, the immobilized PPO showed higher tolerance to various temperatures and pH than free PPO. Hence, immobilized PPO could be useful for the bioremediation of environment contaminated with phenolic compounds like p-cresol.

Introduction

Due to the higher water solubility, certain organic compounds like cresol or oil contained phenol mélanges and some mono-aromatic hydrocarbons were considered as principle contaminants in groundwater (Flyvbjerg et al. 1993; Rosenfeld and Plumb 1991). p-Cresol or 4-methylphenol [CH3C6H4(OH)] is an aromatic compound of phenol derivatives and is generally extracted from coal–tar in coal gasification plants by fractionation and various other synthetic processes (Muller et al. 2001). p-Cresol is a toxic chemical, corrosive in nature, causes nervous system depression and is also a common by-product produced from tyrosine by several anaerobic organisms (Tallur et al. 2006). Hence, it is listed as a significant contaminant by the US Environmental Protection Agency (Tallur et al. 2006).

There are reports on removal/degradation of p-cresol by enzymes, microorganisms and immobilized cells of organism(s) (Gunther et al. 1995; Kolomytseva et al. 2007; Muller et al. 2001; Singh et al. 2008; Tallur et al. 2006, 2009; Vermette 2000; Yamada et al. 2007). However, several disadvantages in the direct microbial detoxification of pollutants were determined. The influence of physicochemical and poor bioavailability of contaminants, the presence of other toxic compounds on microbial growth will directly affect detoxification (Karigar and Rao 2011). Hence, the enzymatic process has an advantage than microorganisms by overcoming these problems for the detoxification of toxic pollutants and is useful for industrial applications. There are reports on copper-containing enzymes like polyphenol oxidases (PPO) which catalyze the oxidation of phenol derivatives in the presence of O2 (Burton 1994; Rapeanu et al. 2006) and also used for the detoxification of other organic contaminants (Bollag et al. 2003; Hou et al. 2011; Rodriguez Couto and Toca Herrera 2006). However, PPOs from different sources might differ in substrate specificity and catalytic competency (Durán et al. 2002). Application of immobilization technology will help in improving the stability of enzyme for the enhanced detoxification of toxic pollutants and fermentation process. Various matrices are used in enzyme immobilization such as chitosan microspheres, polymeric carrier, polyacrylonitrile beads, magnetic chitosan nanoparticles, nano-porous silica beads and alginate-SiO2 hybrid gel (Dehghanifard et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2005; Kalkan et al. 2012; Nicolucci et al. 2011; Shao et al. 2009; Stanescu et al. 2012). Although, many previous studies used immobilized PPOs for the removal of textile dyes, non-textile dyes, aqueous phenol and phenol derivatives (Arabaci and Usluoglu 2014; Khan and Husain 2007; Lončar et al. 2011; Shao et al. 2009), yet, there is not much information available on oxidation of p-cresol by immobilized PPO. With this background, the aim of this study is to explore the possibility of p-cresol degradation by Pleurotus sp. isolate VLECK02 PPO immobilized on various matrices like sodium alginate (SA), sodium alginate–polyvinyl alcohol (SA–PVA) and SA–PVA–silver nanoparticles (AgNPs).
