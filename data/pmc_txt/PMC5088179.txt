
Abstract

Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) are major nosocomial pathogens which cause device-related infections. Presence of various virulence factors along with methicillin resistance favor improved CoNS pathogenicity and their dissemination among population. In the present study, mec gene prevalence was analyzed along with SCC mec diversity among 55 human clinical CoNS isolates. PCR screening of insertion sequence (IS256) was also conducted to elucidate their association with methicillin resistance among selected CoNS species. In addition to this, PCR screening and sequence analysis of novel colonization-associated gene sasX was also carried out. High incidences of mec gene, IS256 and their association have been noted among all of the CoNS species tested. Interestingly, eight CoNS isolates were found to harbor sasX gene including S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus and S. saprophtyicus species. Remarkably they were also found to have the coexistence of mec gene and IS256 in their genome. Increased SCC mec diversity with non-typeable elements was also observed among CoNS isolates. Presence of sasX gene in CoNS with mec gene and insertion sequence 256 and also the identification of non-typeable SCC mec element make the study novel and interesting.

Introduction

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are major component of the normal flora of human cutaneous ecosystem. In recent years, CoNS have emerged as frequent causative agents of nosocomial illness (Lo et al. 2010). More than 14 species of CoNS are currently recognized as human pathogens and the frequently encountered species are S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, S. hominis, and S. saprophyticus (Kloos et al. 1994). The range of infections caused by CoNS include bacteremia, native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pyoarthritis, peritonitis and implanted medical device-related infections (Huebner and Goldmann 1999). The remarkable biofilm formation and ability to acquire and disseminate multidrug resistance have been considered to contribute significantly to the emergence and propagation of CoNS in nosocomial and community settings (Longauerova 2006; Duran et al. 2012). The biofilm formation in CoNS can either be of icaADBC-mediated polysaccharide type or of proteinaceous type (von Eiff et al. 2002) and this reduces bacterial susceptibility to drugs.

As CoNS are part of commensal flora, the presence of drug resistance in them is highly dangerous. The mechanism of resistance to penicillin is mainly dependent on the expression of the mecA gene, which encodes PBP2a transpeptidase with low affinity towards most of the semisynthetic penicillins (Duran et al. 2012). Remarkably mecA gene is present as a part of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCC mec). SCC mec composed of mec gene complex, ccr gene complex and three joining (J) regions. Based on the classes of the mec gene complex and the ccr gene type there are 11 different SCC mec types for S. aureus which itself highlights its importance. But SCC mec elements are likely to be more diverse in MRCoNS due to continuous generation of new composite cassettes that do not fit within the classification proposed for MRSA (Lo et al. 2010; Lebeaux et al. 2011; Zong et al. 2011). Another genetic element, the insertion sequence IS256 which is mainly involved in phase variation of biofilm forming CoNS has been identified to have coexistence with mec gene (Kozitskaya et al. 2005). Autonomous movement and multiple independent insertions of this element into the staphylococcal chromosome together with point mutations, homologous recombination, and horizontal gene transfer act as driving forces for the generation of novel genetic and phenotypic variants. Role of IS256 in association with methicillin heteroresistance in S. aureus and the modulation of methicillin resistance in S. sciuri has also been suggested (Maki and Murakami 1997; Couto et al. 2003). Hence studies on coexistence of mec gene and IS256 among CoNS from clinical samples are highly interesting and significant.

Genetic analysis on association of mecA and IS256 with other newly identified virulence factors may provide deeper insight into emerging molecular programming which is being conducted in CoNS. The novel sasX gene with a signal peptide and LPXTG surface anchoring motif identified from S. aureus with ΦSPβ-like prophage is very significant in this context. No other orthologues for this gene have been reported except in S. epidermidis RP62A ΦSPβ-like prophage which has 95.1% amino acid identity to the sesI gene associated with the clinical strains with invasive properties. SasX provide advantages to the organism due to its role in increased nasal colonization onto host, immune evasion, virulence, bacterial aggregation, biofilm formation and even attachment to the abiotic surfaces (Holden et al. 2010; Li et al. 2012; Otto 2012). In our previous study, we could identify the presence of sasX gene in S. epidermidis (Soumya et al. 2016). Hence in this study, prevalence of sasX gene was analyzed among methicillin-resistant clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci to investigate its relation to mecA gene and IS256.

PCR based molecular analysis for the coexistence of mec gene, IS256 and sasX gene and also SCC mec typing was carried out for CoNS from human clinical samples. The result showed remarkable coexistence and relation between selected genes and also presence of untypeable SCC mec elements in CoNS which provide precautions about the likely role of CoNS to further disseminate these to other microorganisms of human microbiome.
