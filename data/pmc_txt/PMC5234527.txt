Bio-prospecting of cuttle fish waste and
cow dung for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme from Bacillus cereus IND5 in solid state fermentation

Abstract

The process parameters governing the production of fibrinolytic enzyme
in solid state fermentation employing Bacillus
cereus IND5 and using cuttle fish waste and cow dung substrate were
optimized. The pH value of the medium, moisture content, sucrose, casein and
magnesium sulfate were considered for two-level full factorial design and pH, casein
and magnesium sulfate were identified as the important factors for fibrinolytic
enzyme production. Central composite design was applied to investigate the
interactive effect among variables (pH, casein and magnesium sulfate) and response
surface plots were created to find the pinnacle of process response. The optimized
levels of factors were pH 7.8, 1.1% casein and 0.1% magnesium sulfate. Enzyme
production was increased 2.5-fold after statistical approach. The enzyme was
purified up to a specific activity of 364.5 U/g proteins and its molecular weight
was 47 kDa. It was stable at pH 8.0 and was highly active at 50 °C. The mixture of
cuttle fish waste and cow dung could find great application as solid substrate for
the production of fibrinolytic enzyme.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) namely, coronary heart disease, acute
myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis are the leading cause of death. Among
these CVDs, thrombosis is one of the most important diseases (Wang et al.
2006). CVDs are treated by the
extensive use of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase and
streptokinase among other fibrinolytic agents (Holden 1990). However, these fibrinolytic agents cause allergic reactions,
bleeding complications and short half-lives (Blann et al. 2002; Bode et al. 1996; Turpie 2002).
Hence, the search is still vibrant for new and safer fibrinolytic enzymes throughout
the world. In recent years, microbial fibrinolytic enzymes have been considered cost
effective among the other fibrinolytic enzymes. These enzymes have been extensively
studied from insects (Ahn et al. 2003),
snake venom (He et al. 2007), and
marine organisms (Sumi et al. 1992).
Fermented foods namely, natto (Sumi et al. 1987, 1990; Fujita et
al. 1993, 1995), Chungkook-Jang (Kim et al. 1996) and Tempeh (Sugimoto et al. 2007) have also been the source of fibrinolytic
enzyme isolation. Apart from therapeutic applications, fibrinolytic proteases
continue to be attractive as their potent activity on blood clot (He et al.
2007), Keratin (Bressollier et al.
1999) and collagen (Itoi et al.
2006) could have important industrial
waste management and medical applications.

Solid state fermentation (SSF) is emerging as an efficient technique
for production of enzymes and bioconversion of metabolites. Agro-industrial wastes,
waste water and fishery wastes were utilized as cost-effective substrates in
processes of biomolecule production. The agro-wastes namely, green gram husk
(Prakasham et al. 2006), cake of
Jatropha curcas seed (Mahanta et al.
2008), ground nut husk (Salihu et al.
2014), copra waste (Dilipkumar et al.
2013) and wheat bran and
deproteinized acid cheese whey (Raol et al. 2015) were used successfully as the substrate for the enzyme
production. The ideal substrate should be cheap so as to reduce the production cost
of biomolecules (Pandey et al. 2000).
In SSF process, the solid substrate provides required nutrient to the growth of
microbes and enzyme production. Hence, the solid substrate employed for any
bioprocess should be rich in nutrients for the production of biomolecules. Recently,
there is an increase in the exploitation of resources from marine wastes. About
105.6 million tons of fish resources were utilized for human consumption and
34.8 million tons (25% of the fish resource) are treated as waste. The fishery waste
includes whole fish waste, viscera, bones, skin, fish head, gonads, frame liver,
muscle tissue and other parts (Awarenet 2004). However, these wastes were left unused or buried along sea
shore which causes pollution to the environment (Bozzano and Sardà 2002). Several studies were carried out to utilize
these wastes as substrate for enzyme production. The fish wastes included fish meat
wastes (Vázquez et al. 2006), head and
viscera powder (Triki-Ellouz et al. 2003) and waste water (Haddar et al. 2010). These fish wastes were rich of proteins, amino acids and
oils (Ghaly et al. 2013). On the other
hand, cow dung is one of the cheapest biomass which proved to be a useful substrate
in protease (Vijayaraghavan and Vincent 2012), cellulase (Vijayaraghavan et al. 2016a) and fibrinolytic enzyme (Vijayaraghavan et
al. 2016b) production in SSF. It
contains cellulose, carbon, hemicelluloses, ions and trace elements (Fulhage
2000) and it could be a novel
feedstock for better growth of microorganisms (Adegunloye et al. 2007). Considering the nutritive value of fish
waste and cow dung, this combination of feedstock was used as the solid substrate
for fibrinolytic enzyme production.

Statistical designs of experiments help to find the important variable
and concentration of variables for biomolecules production. These were traditionally
evaluated by one–factor–at–a–time strategy. However, it fails most often to nail
down the correct response in an enzyme bioprocess and this can be overcome by
statistical experimental design. The statistical designs such as fractional
factorial design (Liu et al. 2005),
Plackett–Burman (Dilipkumar et al. 2011) and L18-orthogonal array (Mahajan et al.
2012) were used to screen the
significant variables affecting biomolecule production. Response surface methodology
(RSM) was used to find the optimum concentration of these important variables, and
thereby used to enhance the production of acid proteases (Siala et al. 2012), fibrinolytic enzymes (Vijayaraghavan and
Vincent 2014) and β-galactosidase (Raol
et al. 2015). In this study,
optimization of medium components involved in fibrinolytic enzyme production by
Bacillus cereus IND5 using fish waste and cow
dung substrate was carried out using RSM. Based on our knowledge, no work is
available regarding fibrinolytic enzyme production using the mixture of these
feedstock (fish waste and cow dung) in solid state fermentation. Hence, this
substrate was selected for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme.

Materials and methods

Screening of organism producing fibrinolytic enzyme

About 1 g fermented rice was mixed with 100 ml distilled water.
Sample was taken from it and screened for organisms showing proteolytic activity
using skimmed milk agar plates. Ten bacterial cultures, which showed clear zone in
the casein agar plates, were further screened for fibrinolytic enzyme producing
ability. The protease positive isolates were cultured in a medium containing
peptone (3.0%), glucose (1.0%), CaCl2 (0.50%), and
MgSO4 (0.20%). The pH of culture medium was brought to
7.0, and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h at 150 rpm (Gad et al. 2014). After 72 h of incubation, the bacterial
biomass was separated by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min, and 4 °C) and the
extract devoid of cells was used to screen fibrinolytic enzyme activity. Fibrin
plate assay was used to assess the fibrinolytic activity of the extracts. The
fibrinolytic protease activity appeared as a halo zone around the fibrin clot
after incubation at 37 °C for a period of 5 h.

Identification of the bacterial isolate

A bacterial isolate (IND5), which showed good activity based on the
above screening procedures, was further identified using biochemical and
morphological tests (Bednarski 2006).
The 16S rRNA sequencing was carried out using the forward
(5′AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTAG3′) and reverse primer (5′ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC3′) (Rejiniemon et
al. 2015). Amplification of 16S rRNA
gene was carried out using a gradient PCR machine (Peng et al. 2004). The available sequence was compared using
NCBI BLAST and the organism was identified as Bacillus
cereus IND5.

Solid state fermentation (SSF)

Cuttle fish was collected from Kanniyakumari coast and its
by-product was prepared (Souissi et al. 2008). Briefly, gut, stomach and head were removed, rinsed with
double distilled water, heated, minced and dried well at 80 ± 2 °C for 48 h. Cow
dung substrate was processed as described previously (Vijayaraghavan et al.
2012). Equal amount of cuttle fish
and cow dung waste were mixed and used as the substrate. 5 g of substrate (2.5 g
cuttle fish waste +2.5 g cow dung) was taken in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and the
pH of the solid substrate medium was adjusted to 8.0 by the addition of 0.1 M
tris–HCl buffer. The moisture content of SSF medium was adjusted to 70% (v/w).
During the preliminary experiments, the Erlenmeyer flasks were incubated at 37 °C
for 72 h, and at 96 h, the maximum production of fibrinolytic enzyme was
registered. Hence, all fermentations were run for a period of 72 h.

Submerged fermentation

In the present study, B. cereus
IND5 was cultured in submerged fermentation to compare the yield with that of SSF.
For this, 100 ml nutrient broth medium (beef extract, 5 g/l; peptone, 5 g/l; yeast
extract, 1.5 g/l; and sodium chloride) was prepared, sterilized and inoculated
with 0.1 ml of 18 h grown B. cereus IND5. The
Erlenmeyer flask was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The culture was centrifuged at
10,000 rpm for 10 min and the cell free supernatant was used as the crude
enzyme.

Fibrinolytic enzyme assay

The enzyme (0.1 ml) was mixed with 2.5 ml of tris–HCl buffer (pH
7.8) containing calcium chloride (0.01 M). Fibrinolytic activity was assayed on
fibrin substrate. The absorbance was read at 275 nm (Anson 1938; Chang et al. 2000). Enzyme activity was calculated based on the calibration
curve drawn for standard solution of l-Tyrosine. One unit of fibrinolytic enzyme activity (U) was defined
as the amount of enzyme which liberates 1 µg of tyrosine per min under the
standard assay condition. The results of the determination of fibrinolytic
activity were described in units of activity/gram of substrate (U/g).

Selection of important medium components for fibrinolytic enzyme production
by one variable at a time approach

In the present study, the mixture of cuttle fish waste and cow dung
was used as the substrate for the optimization of enzyme production. The effect of
six different carbon sources namely, glucose, starch, trehalose, xylose, sucrose,
and maltose on the production of fibrinolytic enzyme was studied. To evaluate the
influence of nitrogen sources, beef extract, casein, gelatin, urea, and yeast
extract were employed. The solid medium was supplemented with ammonium chloride,
ammonium sulfate, calcium chloride, di-sodium hydrogen phosphate
(Na2HPO4), ferrous sulfate, sodium
di-hydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4), and
sodium nitrate, to evaluate the influence of ions on production of enzyme. These
nutrients were supplemented with the substrate individually. The substrate was
mixed carefully with tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) to adjust the initial moisture to
70%. Then, 500 µl inoculum (10%, v/w) was introduced into the medium and incubated
as described previously. Fifty milliliter of ice cold double distilled water was
poured with the fermented medium and shaken at 150 rpm for 30 min. It was further
centrifuged at a speed of 10,000 rpm for 20 min in a centrifuge maintained at
4 °C. The cell free extract was stored and utilized for fibrinolytic enzyme
assay.

Screening of vital medium components using two-level full factorial
design

A two-level full factorial statistical design, a preliminary medium
optimization strategy to find the important medium components in fibrinolytic
enzyme production, was employed in this study. For screening of vital medium
components, five variables, pH, moisture, sucrose, casein and
MgSO4 were selected. In two-level full factorial design,
each variable is represented at the low (−) level and high (+) level. The design
model is based on the first order polynomial equation:1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

and the same were maintained at 37 °C for 72 h using an incubator. Each experiment
was carried out in duplicate and average value was presented. After statistical
analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA), the important factors were
identified. Design-Expert 9.0 (StatEase Inc, Minneapolis, USA) was sought for the
design of experiments and statistical analysis of data.

Response surface methodology

The significant medium ingredients (pH, casein, and
MgSO4) affecting fibrinolytic enzyme production, as
observed by the two-level full factorial design, were tested for interactive
effects using a central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology.
The selected variables were coded as A (pH), B (casein), and C
(MgSO4) and the following second order model equation was
used to predict the response (Eq. 2).2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The experimental runs were performed in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks as
per the central composite design in randomized manner. The substrate was
sterilized at 121 °C for 20 min and cooled. After which, 10% inoculum (B. cereus IND5) were carefully inoculated under aseptic
conditions. SSF was carried out in an incubator maintained at 37 °C for a period
of 72 h. After fermentation, enzyme in the SSF medium was extracted and enzyme
assay was carried out. The ANOVA was used to evaluate the significant model terms.
The optimum medium composition was obtained using RSM and these optimum conditions
were validated. Design-Expert 9.0 (StatEase Inc, Minneapolis, USA) was the
software program employed to design the experiment and to analyze the data.

Purification of fibrinolytic enzyme from B. cereus IND5

The fibrinolytic enzyme was produced through SSF using B. cereus IND5 using the optimized culture medium. The
crude enzyme was purified by performing ammonium sulfate precipitation, diethyl
aminoethyl cellulose (DEAE cellulose) and casein-agarose affinity chromatography.
50 ml of crude extract was precipitated and 70% saturation was attained by the
addition of ammonium sulfate salt. The precipitate was separated out by
centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 4 °C) and was dissolved in 0.1 M tris–HCl buffer (pH
8.0). It was further dialyzed against water (two changes) and buffer (third
change). The sample was further loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column which was pre
equilibrated with 0.05 M tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The bounded proteins were
eluted with 0.05 M tris buffer containing 0–1.0 M NaCl. NaCl gradient was made
using a gradient maker and all fractions were collected manually. The fractions
(2.0 ml) were analyzed for their protein concentration (Absorbance 280 nm) and
enzyme activity. The active fractions were loaded on casein-agarose affinity
chromatography (Sigma, USA) which was pre equilibrated with 0.02 M tris–HCl
buffer. Elution of the proteins was done with a gradient of buffer with strength
of 0–0.8 M NaCl. The fractions resulting from elution were assayed for
fibrinolytic activity. In each step of enzyme purification, enzyme assay and also
total protein estimation were carried out. Further, specific activity of enzyme,
yield, and purification fold were also measured.

SDS-PAGE analysis and zymography

The highly active fraction from DEAE cellulose chromatography and
affinity chromatography was subjected to analysis for homogeneity. The enzyme
sample was added with SDS sample buffer and boiled for 1 min before loading on to
the SDS-PAGE gel (12%). The molecular markers used were soybean trypsin inhibitor
of 20.1 kDa, carbonic anhydrase of 29 kDa, ovalbumin of 43 kDa, bovine serum
albumin of 66 kDa and phosphorylase b of 97.4 kDa. The protein bands were
visualized by staining using coomassie brilliant blue (R-250). For zymography
analysis, a fibrin substrate containing polyacrylamide gel (12%) was prepared by
adding 0.12% (w/v) fibrinogen and thrombin (100 NIH U/ml). The affinity
chromatography purified-fraction was loaded on this gel. At the end of
electrophoresis, the gel was taken out and incubated with buffer A containing 2.5%
(v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature (30 ± 1 °C). The residual Triton
X-100 was removed by washing the gel with double distilled water for 30 min. The
gel was incubated with buffer A for 4 h. Then the gel was subjected to coomassie
brilliant blue (R-250) staining for 2 h and then destained (overnight). The
fibrinolytic activity of the enzyme was visualized as nonstained region on blue
background.

Evaluation of characteristics of the purified enzyme

The optimal pH needed for the maximized fibrinolytic activity of
enzyme, was estimated using buffers (0.1 M) of different pH namely, pH 3.0 and 4.0
(citrate buffer), pH 5.0 (succinate buffer), pH 6.0 and 7.0 (sodium phosphate
buffer), pH 8.0 (tris buffer) and pH 9.0 and 10.0 (glycine-NaOH buffer). To
evaluate the stability of enzyme activity with respect to pH, the fibrinolytic
enzyme was incubated with the aforementioned buffers, separately and incubated at
37 °C for 1 h before adding the substrate. The influence of temperature on the
activity of enzyme was estimated by performing the reactions at different
temperatures of 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 °C. The stability of the fibrinolytic
enzyme with respect to temperature was estimated by incubating it in the absence
of substrate at different temperatures, 30–70 °C for 1 h. Fibrinolytic activity of
the enzyme was assayed as described earlier. To elucidate the influence of
divalent ions on enzyme activity, the enzyme was incubated for 30 min along with
different divalent ions, namely Ca2+,
Cu2+, Co2+,
Mg2+, Mn2+,
Hg2+, Fe2+, and
Zn2+ at 0.01 M concentrations (Lomate and Hivrale
2011).

Results and discussion

Screening and identification of the fibrinolytic enzyme producing
bacterium

Ten protease producing bacterial isolates were selected after
casein hydrolysis. These protease positive isolates were further evaluated for
production of fibrinolytic enzyme using fibrin plate. Among the ten bacterial
cultures, the cell free extract of an isolate named IND5 produced the highest halo
zone than other isolates (Fig. 1). The
halo zone represents the clearance of fibrin which in turn indicates the
fibrinolytic activity of the strains. The isolate IND5 also produced more
fibrinolytic enzyme in submerged fermentation compared to the other isolates. The
16S rDNA sequence of the isolate IND5 was subjected to BLAST and the sequence
showed a high similarity with Bacillus cereus.
The strain was identified as B. cereus IND5 and accession number was assigned
(KF250421).Fig. 1Fibrinolytic enzyme activity of the bacterial isolates on fibrin

Production of fibrinolytic enzyme in submerged fermentation

B. cereus
IND5 was cultured in nutrient broth medium and enzyme production was found to be
73 U/ml after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C. Submerged fermentation has been widely
used for the production of enzymes. Recently, Bajaj et al. (2014) used submerged fermentation for the
production of fibrinolytic enzyme from Bacillus
sp.

Cuttle fish waste and cow dung mixture for fibrinolytic enzyme production
in SSF

In SSF, enzyme production was found to be maximum after 72 h
incubation at 37 °C (1205 ± 48 U/g). SSF technique has been widely used for the
production of enzymes, antibiotics, secondary metabolites, flavoring compounds and
also animal feeds. SSF process is defined as the one in which microbes get
attached to solid materials and grow, without any free water. In SSF process, the
solid substrate provides anchorage for the cells and supply nutrients. Hence, the
native-like environment is created for the organism and maximum product production
is expected. In recent years, many substrates were mixed and used as the
fermentation medium to confirm its balanced nutritive value. The mixture of
substrates, such as, protein and chitin (Wang et al. 2008b), powdered crab and shrimp shell (Oh et
al. 2000), cuttlefish by-products
powder and wastewater from fish processing industry (Souissi et al. 2008), cuttlefish and shrimp by-products (Ben
Rebah et al. 2008) were used for the
production of various enzymes. The by-products from fish processing support growth
of microbes in an excellent manner. Due to its low cost and easily available
nature, these substrates play a significant role in the production of enzyme
(Rebah and Miled 2013). Mukherjee et
al. (2008) used a mixture of potato
peel with Imperata cylindrica grass as the substrate and produced fibrinolytic
enzyme. Cow dung was reported as a novel substrate for use in SSF aimed at the
production of cellulases (Vijayaraghavan et al. 2016a) and fibrinolytic enzymes (Vijayaraghavan et al.
2016b). Ghorbel et al.
(2005) stated the importance of
balanced nutrients for enzyme production by microbes. Considering the importance
of balanced diet, the combination of cuttlefish by-product and cow dung was used
as a substrate for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme. This result establishes
the use of cuttle fish waste and cow dung mixture for fibrinolytic enzyme
production. In enzyme bioprocess, no defined culture medium has been proposed to
enhance the production of enzymes from various microbial sources. Every organism
is unique in the requirement of its own environmental and nutritive factors for
more enzyme production. Hence, optimization of enzyme production by an individual
organism is a key to enhance enzyme production. These kinds of studies would
provide low cost substrates for enzyme production in industries.

Use of one variable at a time approach (OVAT) for screening medium
components

The traditional OVAT experiment helps to screen the variables
without any complicated analysis. The mixture of cuttle fish waste and cow dung
was used as the substrate for optimization of fibrinolytic enzyme production. In
the present study, experiments were carried out with different carbon (glucose,
starch, trehalose, xylose, sucrose, and maltose), nitrogen (beef extract, casein,
gelatin, urea, and yeast extract) and ionic sources (ammonium chloride, magnesium
sulfate, ammonium sulfate, calcium chloride, di-sodium hydrogen phosphate
(Na2HPO4), sodium di-hydrogen
phosphate (NaH2PO4), ferrous
sulfate, and sodium nitrate) to evaluate the suitable nutrient source for the
process of fibrinolytic enzyme production. All carbon sources, except glucose
containing culture medium did not exhibit fibrinolytic activity than that of
control and this indicated the inducible nature of B. cereus IND5 fibrinolytic
enzyme. Among the carbon sources, sucrose stimulated more enzyme production
(1218 ± 27 U/g) (Fig. 2a). Hence, sucrose
was used as the suitable carbon source. Vijayaraghavan and Vincent (2014) concluded that sucrose was the best carbon
source for fibrinolytic enzyme production for Paenibacillus sp. IND8. Among the nitrogen sources, casein
considerably enhanced fibrinolytic enzyme production (1294 ± 32 U/g)
(Fig. 2b). This result agreed with the
observations made with Bacillus sp. strain
AS-S20-I (Mukherjee and Rai 2011) and
Proteus penneri SP-20 (Jhample et al.
2015). MgSO4
(0.1%, w/w) was found to be the best ionic source for production of fibrinolytic
enzyme (1142 ± 28 U/g). However, addition of ammonium chloride (0.1%, w/w)
negatively influenced the enzyme production (Fig. 2c). Based on OVAT approach, sucrose, casein and
MgSO4 were chosen for further experiments.Fig. 2Effect of carbon source (a)

Medium optimization using 25 full factorial
design

In this study, cow dung and cuttle fish waste were (50:50) used for
the production of enzyme. A two-level five factorial design is a best statistical
tool for studying the production of fibrinolytic enzymes (Liu et al. 2005). This method analyzes the factors in two
levels, i.e., high (+) and low (−), for the screening of important variables or
factors (Table 1). From the results of
preliminary screening carried out by OVAT approach, sucrose, casein and
MgSO4 were selected as the suitable nutritional factors
for evaluating fibrinolytic enzyme production. In this statistical design, along
with these three variables, moisture and pH were also included as the critical
factors for optimizing enzyme production in SSF. The variables and the results of
the experiments were described in the Table 2. In this study, the production of fibrinolytic enzyme varied
between 180 and 5044 U/g. The production of enzyme was observed to be maximum in
the medium containing 80% moisture content, 0.1% sucrose, 0.1% casein, 0.1%
MgSO4 and pH 7.0. ANOVA of the interactive effects were
represented in the Table 3. The F value of this model was 128.47 and it was
statistically significant. There is only a little chance (0.01%) that this much
large “Model F-value” had occurred due to
noise. Hence, the interactive tested variables were found to be statistically
significant. The model terms A, B, D, E, AB, AC, AD, AE, BD, BE, CE, DE, ABC, ABE,
ACD, ACE, ADE, BCD, BCE, BDE, ABCE, ACDE and BCDE were found to be significant.
The predicted R
2 value (0.9263) was found to be close to the adjusted
R
2 value (0.9911). The R
2 value of this model was 0.9988. The equation of the
model can be written using coded levels of factors as:Table 1The independent variables chosen for

The negative coefficients for medium components A (pH), B
(moisture), C (sucrose) and E (MgSO4) indicated that the
enzyme production can be increased by decreasing their concentrations in the
fermentation medium. The positive coefficient for the model term D (casein)
indicated that enzyme production could be increased by increasing the amount of
casein in the SSF medium. Based on the F value
from Table 3, the medium components
casein, MgSO4 and pH were considered as the vital
components for fibrinolytic enzyme production by B. cereus IND5 using cuttle fish
waste and cow dung mixture.

Optimized enzyme production SSF process using RSM

RSM is an ideal statistical tool for optimizing enzyme production.
Recently, RSM was applied for optimized production of cellulases (Singh et al.
2014; Premalatha et al.
2015), fibrinolytic enzyme
(Majumdar et al. 2015) and xylanase
(Khusro et al. 2016). The optimum
concentration of individual process parameters considering the interactive effect
were elucidated using RSM. Hence, the vital parameters were taken at five levels
and SSF was done according to CCD. The factors and their levels were described in
Table 4. The enzyme activity was found
to vary from 1488 to 5364 U/g (Table 5).
ANOVA was used to evaluate the results and the model was statistically significant
with F value of 1276.39 (Table 6). The chance of interplay of noise in the
appearance of this much large F value is as
little as 0.01%. The model terms A, B, C, AC, AB, BC,
A2, B2 and
C2 were significant. The “Lack of fit F value” of 1.02 implies the insignificance of lack of
fit as compared to the pure error. There was an estimated chance of 48.97% that a
“Lack of Fit-value” of this magnitude could occur owing to noise. “The Pred
R-squared” of 0.9960 was close to the “Adj R-Squared” of 0.9983. The second order
polynomial equation is given below.Table 4The independent variables selected for CCD and their coded

To deduce the optimum concentration of each variable for the
enhancement of enzyme production 3D surface plots were constructed using RSM
(Fig. 3). The optimized values of pH,
casein and MgSO4 were 7.8, 1.1 and 0.08%, respectively. To
check the predicted response, a validation experiment was conducted. Under the
optimum levels of medium components, the fibrinolytic enzyme production was
observed to be 5247 ± 37 U/g. The predicted response 5201 U/g was close to the
observed results and this validated the selected model. This finding shows the
aptness of the selected model, indicating that the optimized levels of medium
components favor the fibrinolytic enzyme production in SSF.Fig. 3Three dimensional response surface plots showing the effect of

The culture medium cost is approximately 30–40% of total production
cost of enzymes (Joo et al. 2003),
hence the application of low cost substrate could reduce the overall enzyme cost.
In the present observation, enzyme yield was found to be high in SSF than
submerged fermentation. The processing cost of cow dung and cuttle fish waste was
approximately 10 INR/kg material. The cost of one of the commercially available
culture medium (Nutrient broth, HIMEDIA, Mumbai, India) was approximately 4 INR/g
material. The approximate yield and production medium cost was 1400 U/INR in
submerged fermentation, whereas 500,000 U/INR in SSF. The media cost was more than
100 times cheap in SSF than submerged fermentation. Thus, the use of cuttle fish
waste and cow dung could reduce minimum 30% of overall enzyme cost.

Downstream purification of the produced fibrinolytic enzyme

In this study, fibrinolytic enzyme was purified by the combination
of ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and
affinity chromatography using casein–agarose matrix. The ammonium sulfate
precipitation showed 22,040 U of fibrinolytic enzyme with 43% yield, and 1.3-fold
purification was achieved. The specific activity of fibrinolytic enzyme was
increased to 143 U/mg protein after DEAE-cellulose chromatography purification.
The affinity chromatography purified fractions showed 364.5 U/mg protein. The
highly active fraction from DEAE cellulose and casein-agarose chromatography
fractions was analyzed for its homogeneity. The DEAE chromatography fractions
showed partial purification of enzyme. The affinity purified enzyme migrated as a
single band in SDS-PAGE gel and the molecular weight was found to be 47 kDa
(Fig. 4). The molecular weight of
bacterial fibrinolytic enzyme varies widely. In B. subtilis KCK-7, the molecular
weight was registered as 44 kDa (Paik et al. 2004); however, the molecular weight of fibrinolytic enzyme from
B. subtilis LD-8547 was reported as 30 kDa
(Wang et al. 2008a).Fig. 4

Characterization of the produced fibrinolytic enzyme

The characterization of the purified enzyme was done by analyzing
the effect of temperature, pH, and ionic strength on its stability and activity.
Figure 5a revealed the effect of pH on
enzyme activity and stability. B. cereus IND5
fibrinolytic enzyme showed maximum activity at pH 8.0 and was stable in the range
of pH from 7.0 to 9.0 which throws light on the possible applications of this
enzyme in a plethora of industrial sectors. This result was acceptable with
respect to the previously published results. The fibrinolytic enzyme isolated from
various Bacillus sp. showed optimum activity in
the range, pH 8.0–9.0 (Agrebi et al. 2010; Mahajan et al. 2012; Bajaj et al. 2013). B. cereus IND5
fibrinolytic enzyme showed maximum activity at 50 °C (Fig. 5b). Bajaj et al. (2013) reported that several Bacillus sp. fibrinolytic enzymes have shown optimum activity at
35–40 °C. However, 60 °C was optimum for the activity of fibrinolytic enzyme
produced from B. subtilis A26 (Agrebi et al.
2009). B.
cereus IND5 fibrinolytic enzyme activity was inhibited by the
presence of tested metal ions except Mg2+ and
Ca2+ (Fig. 5c). It was previously reported that the fibrinolytic enzyme of
B. subtilis A26 was activated in the presence
of Ba2+, Cu2+,
K+, Mg2+,
Mn2+ and Na+ and enzyme
activity was inhibited by the addition of Zn2+ and
Hg2+ (Agrebi et al. 2009). In B. subtilis ICTF-1,
fibrinolytic enzyme activity was inhibited by ions like
Zn2+, Hg2+ and
Fe3+ (Mahajan et al. 2012).Fig. 5Biochemical characterization of the purified fibrinolytic

Conclusion

The present study revealed that B.
cereus IND5 effectively utilized cuttle fish
waste and cow dung for its growth and enzyme production. This substrate could have
unprecedented potential for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme. The interactions
of pH, casein, and magnesium sulfate were evaluated by response surface methodology.
Fibrinolytic enzyme production was significantly increased by altering the medium pH
and at increased concentration of casein. The purified enzyme was highly active at
50 °C and was stable up to pH 8.0. Considering these properties, it could be useful
for various biotechnological applications.
