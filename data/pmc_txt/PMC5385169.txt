Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is an ancient oilseed crop known for its nutty seeds and high-quality edible oil. It is an unexplored crop with a great economic potential. The present study deals with assessment of genetic diversity in the crop. Twenty two RAPD and 18 SSR primers were used for analysis of the 47 different sesame accessions grown in different agroclimatic zones of India. A total of 256 bands were obtained with RAPD primers, of which 191 were polymorphic. SSR primers gave 64 DNA bands, of which all of were polymorphic. The Jaccard ºs similarity coefficient of RAPD, SSR, and pooled RAPD and SSR data ranged from 0.510 to 0.885, 0.167 to 0.867, and 0.505 to 0.853, respectively. Maximum polymorphic information content was reported with SSRs (0.194) compared to RAPDs (0.186). Higher marker index was observed with RAPDs (1.426) than with SSRs (0.621). Similarly, maximum resolving power was found with RAPD (4.012) primers than with SSRs (0.884). The RAPD primer RPI-B11 and SSR primer S16 were the most informative in terms of describing genetic variability among the varieties under study. At a molecular level, the seed coat colour was distinguishable by the presence and absence of a group of marker amplicon/s. White and brown seeded varieties clustered close to each other, while black seeded varieties remained distanced from the cluster. In the present study, we found higher variability in Sesamum indicum L. using RAPD and SSR markers and these could assist in DNA finger printing, conservation of germplasm, and crop improvement.

Introduction

Sesamum indicum L. (Pedaliaceae), commonly known as sesame or Gingelly, is an ancient oilseed crop cultivated in almost all continents. It is a source of high-quality edible oil that contains, in addition, medicinally important antioxidant lignans, namely, sesamin, sesamolin, and sesamol (Anilakumar et al. 2010; Dar et al. 2014). Lignans impart resistance to rancidity of the oil and enhance tumor inhibiting properties of certain drugs (Sacco et al. 2007; Dar and Arumugam 2013; Dar et al. 2015). India, Sudan, and China are the major sesame producing countries. However, the global per unit area production of sesame seed, especially in developing countries, is far less (FAO STAT 2014). The low yield has been attributed to indeterminate growth, uneven ripening of capsules, absence of non-shattering types, and biotic and abiotic stresses (Ashri 1998). Importance of crop genetic diversity in the era of post green revolution and threat by change cannot be over emphasized (Abberton et al. 2015). A focused research on genetic diversity and breeding of sesame is needed to improve its worldwide productivity.

Morpho-agronomic traits have been the prime variables used for studying genetic diversity (Liu 1997; Bisht et al. 1998). Selection of plant varieties based on these traits alone has proved to be ineffective due to problems of low heritability, strong influence of the environment, and genetic complexity. Fortunately, advances in molecular technologies have enabled proper identification, selection, and use of germplasm in crop improvement programmes (Spandana et al. 2012). DNA markers in particular are useful and reliable as they remain stable under different environmental conditions (Ferdinandez et al. 2001). Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is the simplest of all molecular techniques enabling quick detection of polymorphisms at a number of loci with only small amounts (nanogram) of genomic DNA required (Bhat et al. 1999; Salazar et al. 2006; Pham et al. 2011). RAPD technique first reported by Welsh and McClelland and Williams et al. has been routinely used for genetic analysis in a vast array of crops, including foxtail millet, sunflower, birch, soybean, and oilseed rape (Schontz and Rether 1999; Popov et al. 2002; Xu and Gai 2003; Zeng et al. 2003; Yu et al. 2005). Simple sequence repeat (SSR) is yet another popular DNA marker used in the assessment of the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and population structures in crops. SSR markers are tandem repeats of short nucleotide sequences of about one-to-six bases that have revealed a high polymorphism in several crops, including barley (Malysheva-Otto et al. 2006), perilla (Park et al. 2008), and rice (Cui et al. 2010). The polymorphism with this marker arise either due to polymerase slippage during DNA replication or unequal crossing over (Levinson and Gutman 1987). The SSR has advantage of identifying many alleles at a single locus, extensive genome coverage, co-dominance, and repeatability, can be carried out with just a small quantity of DNA (ng), and avoids radioactivity (Abdelkrim et al. 2009; Allentoft et al. 2009). The SSR markers have also proved useful in the preparation of genetic map by linking it with other markers (Nimmakayala et al. 2005).

As compared to many crop plants, information on molecular characterization of genetic diversity in sesame has been very meagre. The molecular techniques of RAPD (Bhat et al. 1999; Ercan et al. 2004; Kumar and Sharma 2009; Pham et al. 2011; Akbar et al. 2011; Mahdizadeh et al. 2012), AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) (Laurentin and Karlovsky 2006, 2007), ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeats) (Kim et al. 2002; Parsaeian et al. 2011; Kumar and Sharma 2011; Nyongesa et al. 2013; Woldesenbet et al. 2015), SSR (Spandana et al. 2012; Dixit et al. 2005; Cho et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012; Yepuri et al. 2013; Wei et al. 2014; Surapaneni et al. 2014; Uncu et al. 2015; Dossa et al. 2016; Sehr et al. 2016), and SRAP (sequence-related amplified polymorphism) (Li and Quiros 2001; Li et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2010) have been used to evaluate the genetic diversity in sesame of different origins. Morphologically, Indian collection of sesame is characterized by variable forms being cultivated in different agroclimatic zones. The molecular data on the diversity of Indian germplasm are very limited. In this paper, we describe comparative evaluation of molecular genetic diversity of the sesame varieties of Indian origin using RAPD and SSR markers. The results are discussed in the light of developing strategy for breeding and conservation of the crop.
