The aim of this study was to produce sugarcane plantlets from cell suspension culture and study its genetic fidelity using molecular markers. The study was carried out using sugarcane varieties Co 86032 and Q117. Callus cultures of both the varieties were optimized using six different callus induction media. After screening the growth response of callus on six different callus induction media, it was observed that medium no. VI supplemented with 500 mg l−1 of each PVP, Casein hydrolysate and MES buffer showed high amounts of callus in Co 86032 (79.66 ± 0.44%) and Q117 (82.83 ± 1.69%). Addition of PEG 8000 at 2.5% to this medium had a profound impact on inducing somatic embryogenesis in Co 86032 (54.66 ± 1.76%) and Q117 (66.66 ± 2.60%) as compare to control (24.33 ± 1.76%) and (27.33 ± 2.73%), respectively. Cell suspension cultures were established by culturing embryogenic calli in liquid medium showed well established suspension cultures with fever cell aggregates. There was negligible cell division during initial 2 days of incubation and cell count increased rapidly between 2 and 8 days. Further incubation beyond 8 days resulted in a decrease in cell viability. Enhanced callus proliferation in Q117 while enhanced shoot regeneration in Co 86032 was observed from cell suspension culture. The clonal fidelity of in vitro regenerated plants was assessed by using RAPD and ISSR markers. Analysis of the ten RAPD markers indicated that 90.48 and 86.95% true-to-type regenerated plantlets in Co 86032 and Q117, respectively. However, in the ISSR markers, Co 86032 did not show any polymorphism and in the Q117, 92.18% true-to-type plantlets were found. These results confirmed that somaclonal variation occurs during the process of indirect organogenesis and RAPD and ISSR marker based molecular analysis is a suitable method for an early detection of variation in sugarcane.

Introduction

Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.), is an important cash crop which contributes to around 70–80% of sugar production globally. It is cultivated in the tropical and sub-tropical regions and ranks amongst the top ten cultivated crops in the world (Suprasanna et al. 2011). In India, sugarcane has secured a distinct position after cotton as an agro-industrial crop, due to it being a prominent source of vital product (sugar) as well as by-products (baggasse, molasses, pressmud, etc.) which plays a major role in the economic progress of small and large scale industrial sectors. Sugarcane has been recognized as the most competent crop which converts solar energy into harvestable chemical energy in the form of sucrose and biomass (Joyce et al. 2010).

Currently, the development of somatic embryogenesis through callus and suspension culture has great potential for propagation at a rapid rate (Dewanti et al. 2016). It was reported that all the regenerated plants from the tissue culture are not true-to-type like the parent. Phenotypic variation is commonly observed amongst regenerated plants which are associated with genetic changes of an organism. These changes could result from mutations, epigenetic changes or a combination of both mechanisms. Somaclonal variation is the genetic variability, which has occurred during tissue culture or variants derived from any form of cell or tissue cultures (Larkin and Scowcroft 1981). The occurrence of somaclonal variation arising through cryptic gene defects can seriously limit the application of micropropagation for clonal multiplication (Rani and Raina 2000). These variations in genomic DNA of regenerants restrict the utility of plant micropropagation techniques for large-scale multiplication. The inability for quick identification of these polymorphisms at cytological, biochemical, phenotypic and molecular levels in micropropagated sugarcane poses a challenge. The rapid detection is beneficial to check the homogeneity between mother and in vitro grown plantlets (Devarumath et al. 2002). The PCR associated DNA molecular markers based analysis system such as Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), Simple sequence Repeat (SSR), Inter-sequence simple repeats (ISSR) and microsatellite DNA/SSRs possess several benefits over the traditional methods that have been used for detection of polymorphism and genotyping in plant systems (Lal et al. 2008; Guasmi et al. 2012; Rajpal et al. 2014). The RAPD and ISSR analysis has been widely used to determine polymorphism in genomic DNA in sugarcane and several other plant systems due to numerous advantages like being a relatively fast, simple, cost-effective technique which requires a small quantity of DNA sample with no preliminary sequence information for primer design (Suprasanna et al. 2006; Devarumath et al. 2007; Lal et al. 2008; Rizvi et al. 2012; Dangi et al. 2014; Kshirsagar et al. 2015).

The present work was performed with an objective to establish sugarcane (Co 86032 and Q117) suspension culture and subsequent regeneration of plantlets and study their genetic variation occurred during the process of regeneration using molecular markers (RAPD and ISSR).
