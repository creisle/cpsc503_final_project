
Abstract

3-Ketosteroid-∆1-dehydrogenase (KstD), a key enzyme in microbial steroid catabolism, catalyzes the trans-axial elimination of the C1 and C2 hydrogen atoms of the A-ring from the polycyclic ring structure of 3-ketosteroids, and it was usually used to transform androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (AD) to produce androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione. Here, the KstD from Gordonia neofelifaecis was expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli. E. coli cells expressing KstD3gor were subjected to the investigation of dehydrogenation activity for different steroids. The results showed that KstD3gor has a clear preference for steroid substrates with 3-keto-4-ene configuration, and it exhibits higher activity towards steroid substrates carrying a small or no aliphatic side chain than towards substrates having a bulky side chain at the C-17 atom. The recombinant strain could efficiently convert androst-4,9-dien-3,17-dione into androst-1,4,9-trien-3,17-dione (with conversion rate of 96%). 1-Dehydrogenation of androst-4,9-dien-3,17-dione is one of the key steps in glucocorticoid production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting on the conversion of androst-4,9-dien-3,17-dione catalyzed by recombinant KstD; the expression system of KstD3gor reported here would have an impact in the industrial production of glucocorticoid in the future.



Introduction

Significant progress has been made over the last ten years in the use of enzymes and microorganisms for the manufacturing of complex chemical compounds and replacing multi-steps chemical syntheses. Actinobacteria are known as efficient biocatalysts of steroid bioconversion since 1913 (Tak 1942). However, the recent advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics technologies provided tools for identification of new players in cholesterol bioconversion. Although steroids are highly resistant to biodegradation, many bacteria use them as a source of carbon and energy (García et al. 2012). Microbial transformation could be carried out under mild reaction conditions with excellent yields of products and remarkable regio- and stereo-selectivity, which is hardly available for chemical synthesis. Therefore, for producing novel steroidal drugs and generating active pharmaceutical ingredients, microbial transformation is employed as a novel, efficient and economical tool (Donova 2007; García et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2015). For example, side chains of phytosterol, a byproduct from soybeans, sugar and paper industries, can be selectively degraded by a process similar to the β-oxidation of fatty acids, yielding 17-ketosteroids (Wei et al. 2010). One of the products of this degradation, 9α-hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, and its ∆9-analog are considered as the most important intermediates for the synthesis of corticoids such as prednisolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone (Fokina and Donova 2003; Yuan et al. 2015). The efficiency of enzymatic processes and purity of their products have obvious advantages in comparison with multi-steps chemical syntheses of hormonal drugs. However, the development of steroid biotechnology requires further studies of microorganisms able to degrade/modify steroids as well as enzymes catalyzing these reactions on the molecular level (Yang et al. 2015).

The degradation of cholesterol or its derivatives begins with the transformation of cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one by a cholesterol oxidase (Shao et al. 2015). The subsequent catabolism involves elimination of the alkyl side chain followed by the opening of the rings A/B and rings C/D. A 3-ketosteroid Δ1-dehydrogenase (KstD) [EC 1.3.99.4], catalyzing the elimination of the hydrogen atoms of the C-1 and C-2 in the A-ring from the polycyclic ring structure of 3-ketosteroids, is a key enzyme in microbial steroid catabolism needed for the opening of the steroid B-ring (Fernández de Las Heras et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013). KstD is a FAD-dependent enzyme, the natural electron acceptor appears to be vitamin K2 (Choi et al. 1995a), and they can transfer electrons to N-methyl phenazolium sulfate. KstDs were found in various bacteria, including Mycobacterium sp., Rhodococus sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Arthrobacter sp. (Choi et al. 1995b; Molnar et al. 1995; van der Geize et al. 2000; Brzostek et al. 2005; Knol et al. 2008). They display a broad substrate spectrum. The KstD1SQ1 (KstD1 from Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1) and KstD2SQ1 enzymes (KstD2 from Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1) were specific for steroids with the 3-keto-4-ene structure such as 9α-hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (Knol et al. 2008). KstD3SQ1 (KstD3 from Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1) had a clear preference for 3-ketosteroids with a saturated A-ring. The role of three KstDs from Rhodococcus ruber strain Chol-4 was studied in the steroid metabolism (Fernández de Las Heras et al. 2012).

KstD proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (Wei et al. 2014), Bacillus subtilis (Zhang et al. 2013), Streptomyces lividans (Choi et al. 1995a), Rhodococcus erythropolis (Knol et al. 2008), Mycobacterium neoaurum (Morii et al. 1998), etc., and used to convert androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (AD) into androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (Choi et al. 1995b; Morii et al. 1998; Knol et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2013; Wei et al. 2014). An interesting possibility to use KstD for the 1-dehydrogenation of androst-4,9-dien-3,17-dione [4,9-AD] (a step of the pathway for glucocorticoid production, as shown in Fig. 1) has not been tested.Fig. 1Dehydrogenation reaction in industrial production of fluorocorticoid from 9α-OH-AD. I 9α-hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione; II androst-4,9-dien-3,17-dione; III androst-1,4,9-trien-3,17-dione; IV 16α,17α-epoxy-pregn-4,9-dien-21-ol-3,20-dione; V dexamethasone

Gordonia neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395 was initially isolated from fresh faeces of a clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) for its ability to degrade cholesterol (Liu et al. 2011). In spite of a significant number of known actinobacteria that could degrade/modify steroids, only a few genomes of them have been completely sequenced to identify all sterol catabolic genes. We sequenced G. neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395 genome and found 5 putative genes encoding KstD (Ge et al. 2011; Li et al. 2014). We also studied the substrate specificity of these KstDs in our former study (Zhang et al. 2015). One enzyme, KstD3gor, had the broadest spectrum of substrate specificity, exhibiting activity to progesterone, 16α, 17α-epoxyprogesterone and cholest-4-en-3-one.

In this work, we cloned KstD3gor gene into E. coli vector, expressed the recombinant enzyme and characterized its enzyme specificity and selectivity. Our results indicated that KstD3gor could have a possible application for the production of androst-1,4,9-trien-3,17-dione in the pharmaceutical industry.
