
Abstract

The potential of untreated Parthenium hysterophorus weed biomass was evaluated as a substrate for cellulase production. The cellulose in the biomass was used as the main source of carbon. Solid-state fermentation was carried out using Trichoderma reesei, and optimization of cultural conditions was done for maximization of cellulase production. The results revealed that highest cellulase production was achieved on the 8th day of incubation, at 30 °C, keeping solid-to-liquid ratio 1:2 when two discs of inoculum were used per gram of the substrate. The optimized inoculum age was 96 h for CMCase and 120 h for FPase. On studying the enhancing effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources, lactose and ammonium molybdate were found suitable, respectively. The optimized concentration of lactose for the highest CMCase and FPase activities was 1.5 and 1%, respectively. Ammonium molybdate was best at 1% concentration for both CMCase and FPase. Maximum CMCase and FPase activities obtained were 20.49 and 2.42 U/gds, respectively.
