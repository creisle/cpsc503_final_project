Gravity is the fundamental force that may have operated during the evolution of life on Earth. It is thus important to understand as to what the effects of gravity are on cellular life. The studies related to effect of microgravity on cells may provide greater insights in understanding of how the physical force of gravity shaped life on Earth. The present study focuses on a unique group of organisms called the Haloarchaea, which are known for their extreme resistance to survive in stress-induced environments. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of simulated microgravity on physiological response of extremely halophilic archaeon, Haloarcula argentinensis RR10, under slow clinorotation. The growth kinetics of the archaeon in microgravity was studied using the Baryani model and the viable and apoptotic cells were assessed using propidium iodide fluorescent microscopic studies. The physiological mechanism of adaptation was activation of ‘salt-in’ strategy by intracellular sequestration of sodium ions as detected by EDAX. The organism upregulated the production of ribosomal proteins in simulated microgravity as evidenced by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization Time of flight–Mass Spectrophotometry. Simulated microgravity altered the antibiotic susceptibility of the haloarchaeon and it developed resistance to Augmentin, Norfloxacin, Tobramycin and Cefoperazone, rendering it a multidrug resistant strain. The presence of antibiotic efflux pump was detected in the haloarchaeon and it also enhanced production of protective carotenoid pigment in simulated microgravity. The present study is presumably the first report of physiological response of H. argentinensis RR10 in microgravity simulated under slow clinorotation.





Discussion

Understanding the evolution of life-forms on Earth and their survival during initial extremely unfavorable environmental conditions is of paramount importance. With the progression of life, the inherent and acquired abilities to survive in multiple stresses especially altered gravity may have been a key factor for survival of organisms. Haloarchaea are a unique group of poly-extremophilic organisms with unusual features and are known to survive multiple stresses. Their physiological robustness and ability to survive in the presence of steep fluctuations in temperature, atmosphere, oxygen, radiations, salinity, perchlorate, epsomite, gravity and numerous other stresses has always intrigued scientists. They are apt model exo-philes to study possible effect and adaptability of life forms in spacecraft, in altered gravity like microgravity and hypergravity, as well as in outer space (Thombre et al. 2017). Currently, studies aim at understanding the effect of changes in mechanical forces that occur in microgravity and other low-shear environments on different microbial parameters (Nickerson et al. 2004). Microgravity is known to affect the physiology of cells, gene expression and increase the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms (Xu et al. 2015). Previously studies have been conducted on the effect of space like conditions including microgravity on growth of Escherichia coli (Xu et al. 2015), Salmonella typhimurium (Wilson et al. 2007), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Purevdorj-Gage et al. 2006) and plants (Jagtap et al. 2011). The effect of simulated microgravity in clinorotation have been studied using E. coli (Brown et al. 2002; Arunasri et al. 2013) and the fungi Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans (Yamazaki et al. 2012). However, this is the first report on effect of simulated microgravity on extremely halophilic archaeon H. argentinensis RR10 in clinorotation. This strain was isolated from a harsh hypersaline thalossohaline salterns of Mumbai, India. This haloarchaeon was selected for the present study as it is a poly-extremophile and it demonstrated survival over a wide range of salinity, magnesium concentration, temperature and pH.

On exposure to simulated microgravity, the haloarchaeon H. argentinensis RR10 still continued to demonstrate faster growth as evidenced by increase in absorbance, lesser doubling time and higher percentage viability observed by fluorescence microscopy in comparison to the cells cultured in normal gravity. E. coli when exposed to simulated microgravity showed a similar statistically significant increase in growth as compared to E. coli incubated in NG (Xu et al. 2015). The exact responses and adaptations that haloarchaea elicit in stresses and such altered gravity environment is still unidentified. The general strategies these organisms utilize in ionic stresses are the ‘salt-in strategy’ and the ‘organic osmolyte strategy’ also referred to as compatible solute strategy. In the organic osmolyte strategy, haloarchaea synthesize or carry out the uptake of organic compatible solutes in the cytosol. Thus, the osmotic potential is counter balanced despite maintenance of low salt intracellularly. The compatible solutes are ectoine, glycine betaine, trehalose, sorbitol, glycerol and amino acid derivatives. This strategy is more common in halophilic bacteria. The ‘salt-in strategy’ is employed by true halophiles, including halophilic archaea and extreme haloarchaea (Shivanand and Mugeraya 2011). In this mechanism the organism selectively sequesters the cations (sodium or potassium) inside the cytoplasm instead of synthesizing organic osmolytes so as to maintain the ionic concentration in the cell equivalent or higher than the external environment (Jensen et al. 2015). As the ‘salt- in strategy’ is common in extreme haloarchaea, occurrence of this strategy in simulated microgravity was studied by detecting the intracellular archaeal accumulation of ions by H. argentinensis RR10 using EDAX analysis. In the current study, H. argentinensis RR10 demonstrated greater sequestration of chloride followed by sodium ions in NG as compared to SMG conditions. Presence of a light independent Cl− transport channel (Nad and Nac complex) has been identified in the genome of Haloarcula marismortui. Similarly, haloarchaea possess halorhodopsin which is a light gated ion channel or a light driven chloride pump that is causal for chloride accumulation inside the cell (Jensen et al. 2015). It is known that the archaeon H. argentinensis has presence of retinal proteins in the membrane (Ihara et al. 1997). The isolate may thus use halorhodopsin or the light independent Na+/Cl− symporter or transporter to sequester chloride ions in cytoplasm during its growth in normal gravity of 1g. The chloride anions may possibly react with the hydroxyl radicals in the cell to generate lesser reactive chloride radicals that tend to mitigate the deleterious effects of oxidative damage caused by more reactive hydroxyl radicals. Generally, haloarchaea increase the intracellular influx of potassium ions instead of sodium ions, driven by proton motive force via a Trk K+/H+ symport while growth in osmotic stress (Jensen et al. 2015). However, in H. argentinensis RR10, the sequestration of sodium ions is higher as compared to potassium ions. This may be due to the plausible preferential sequestration of sodium ions and replacement of potassium ion when exposed to SMG.

The study of differential proteins expression was studied in H. argentinensis. The differences in the bands present in the protein fraction of the isolate incubated in SMG and NG was apparent. Previous studies have reported a notable difference in protein profile when H. mediterranei DSM 1411T and Halococcus dombrowskii DSM 14522T were exposed to SMG in exponential phase (Dornmayr-Pfaffenhuemer et al. 2011). However, the proteins expressed in haloarchaea in response to simulated microgravity were not identified previously (Dornmayr-Pfaffenhuemer et al. 2011). Moreover, when the proteins are separated using 2-D gel electrophoresis, the majority of haloarchaeal proteins being acidic, aggregate and cluster as they are in a narrow pI range (4.2–5.2) causing difficulty in separation and study of these proteins (Thombre et al. 2016b). To avoid these problems in the present study, we directly excised the differential protein band expressed in simulated microgravity conditions in 1-D SDS-PAGE gels and trypsinized them and attempted to identify the peptide mass fingerprint generated using MALDI-TOF MS (Trotter et al. 2015). The major peptide samples analyzed and identified by MASCOT revealed the presence of 50S ribosomal protein L22, 50S ribosomal protein L31e, 30S ribosomal protein S8, 30S ribosomal protein S11and Translation initiation factor 2 subunit-betain H. argentinensis. Studies related to the proteome analysis of cells exposed to SMG are limited. The proteomic analysis of Daphnia exposed to SMG demonstrated upregulation of proteins related to actin microfilament organization, protein folding and energy metabolism-related proteins (Trotter et al. 2015). The genomic studies related to haloarchaea reveal that genes encoding for functional classes of chaperones (CHP), signal transduction (SIG) and cellular processes (CP) are up regulated during exponential phase as compared to stationary phase (Lange et al. 2007). The changes in environmental conditions leads to stress which is the cardinal causal factor responsible for upregulation of chaperonins, proteasomal proteins and small heat shock proteins (sHSP’s) in haloarchaea (Thombre and Oke 2015; Thombre et al. 2016b). The genomic data of E. coli K12 MG1655(cultured in microgravity under clinorotation) analyzed based on the DAVID geneontology (GO) term enrichments revealed that genes for DNA transcription, helicases, multidrug efflux system and small RNA were upregulated and genes involving stress proteins were downregulated (Arunasri et al. 2013). A global response to simulated microgravity involving a general regulator of transcription has been envisaged in bacteria (Wilson et al. 2007).In the present study, the maximum proteins differentially expressed were ribosomal proteins indicating activation transcription process. This indicates that microgravity does not hamper growth of the organisms, on the contrary the archaeon continues to demonstrate active transcription process.

Haloarchaea are extremely resistant to antibiotics and when cells are exposed to microgravity, their antibiotic resistance increases markedly (Dornmayr-Pfaffenhuemer et al. 2011). When H. argentinensis was exposed to SMG, it altered the resistance pattern of the organism and it developed resistance to many antibiotics like Augmentin, Norfloxacin, Tobramycin and Cefoperazone in addition to its resistance to Nalidixic acid. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the organism are altered during microgravity and analogous findings of increase in susceptibility to antibiotic flucanozole by C. albicans in response to SMG stress has been reported (Jiang et al. 2014). Currently the data regarding drug resistance and break points as per Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for classification of multi drug resistance in haloarchaea is not available. As per CLSI and EUCAST an organism is considered multi drug resistant if it develops resistance to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories (Mapara et al. 2015; Shinde and Thombre 2016). Since H. argentinensis RR10 developed resistance to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories (viz. Aminoglycoside, Quinolone, Fluoroquinolone, Cephalosporins and Penicillin) it can be inferred that the haloarchaeon develops multi drug resistance on exposure to simulated microgravity. Exposure to simulated microgravity thus increases the antibiotic resistance and renders the culture as Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) strain of H. argentinensis RR10.

Microbial mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics are plasmid encoded resistance, cell wall alterations, and changes in permeability of membranes, production of antibiotic inactivating enzymes and activation of drug efflux pumps (Mapara et al. 2015). Multidrug resistance in microorganisms has garnered impending importance in public health during recent times due to its inherent role in causing life threatening diseases and outbreaks. The antibiotic resistance of haloarchaea is thus of paramount significance as its role in pathogenesis and etiology in human disease is still largely unknown. Besides, considering that these organisms are used to study astrobiology and as exposure to microgravity increases their pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance (Wilson et al. 2007) further studies related to the mechanisms of drug resistance in these haloarchaea is imperative. Studies related to the presence of antibiotic efflux pumps in haloarchaea are meagre. Antibiotic efflux pump has been detected only in Haloferax volcanii that mediates the transport of doxorubicin, vinblastin, vincristin, ethidium and monensin (Miyauchi et al. 1992). In the present study, we have reported the presence of antibiotic efflux pump in H. argentinensis RR10 using the modified ethidium bromide cartwheel assay for the first time. The increase in pigmentation due to synthesis of carotenoid was also notable in haloarchaea exposed to SMG. These carotenoid pigments are involved in cellular protection of the haloarchaea against oxidative damage caused by deleterious effects of stress.
