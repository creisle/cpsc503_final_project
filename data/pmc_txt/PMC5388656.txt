
Abstract

Fluorescent Pseudomonas, aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria possess many traits that make them well suited as biocontrol and growth promoting agents. Our study revealed that isolates vary in mechanisms involved in the antagonist interactions against pathogen and growth stimulatory effects on host plant. Most of the potential antagonistic fluorescent Pseudomonas identified were avid iron chelators (P233, P201, 176, P76 and, P76). Wide variation in ACCd enzyme production was observed. ACCd enzyme assay tested P141 > P247 > P126, as potential ACCd enzyme producer. Cynogenic fluorescent Pseudomonas isolates P76 and P124 exerted strong inhibitory against S. rolfsii. However, another cynogenic fluorescent Pseudomonas P179 had no influence against R solani and S. rolfsii which remains unexplained. Noticeable crop specific plant growth stimulation exerted by different fluorescent Pseudomonas was observed on wheat (P124), chickpea (P72), lathyrus (P85, P216), greengram (P11), blackgram (P99, P233); bottlegourd (P248, P167); rice (P176, P247).



Introduction

Aerobic gram negative Fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. have emerged as the largest and potentially most promising group of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria involved in the bio-control of plant diseases (Weller et al. 2002; Fravel 2005). A large number of secondary metabolites, growth hormones, antibiotics and chelating compounds such as siderophores (Choudhary et al. 2009; Beneduzi et al. 2012) are known to be released by these fluorescent pseudomonads. They maintain soil health by employing a wide variety of mechanisms including nitrogen fixation, enhanced solubilization of phosphate and phytohormone production (such as auxin and cytokinin). Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) competitively colonize plant roots and stimulate plant growth and/or reduce the incidence of plant disease. Fluorescent Pseudomonas applied to seed or soil provides excellent control against plant pathogens (De La Fuente et al. 2006; Lagzian et al. 2013). Pseudomonas spp. produce an arsenal of antimicrobials (including hydrogen cyanide, HCN), pyoluteorin, phenazines, pyrrolnitrin, siderophores, cyclic lipopeptides and 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) (Thomashow and Weller 1991; Weller 2007). This is considered as an indirect strategy to promote plant growth as well as the ability to induce systemic resistance in plants (Santoyo et al. 2012; Glick 2014). In this study, we evaluated the fluorescent isolates for siderophore and HCN production. PGPR and their interactions with plants are exploited commercially (Podile and Kishore 2007) and hold great promise for sustainable agriculture. Applications of these associations were investigated in Wheat (Triticum aestivum), Chickpea (Cicer arientinum), Lathyrus (Lathyrus sativus), Greengram (Vigna radiata), Blackgram (Vigna mungo), Bottlegourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and Rice (Oryza sativa) through seed bacterization.
