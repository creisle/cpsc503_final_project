
Abstract

Many efforts have been made to produce cellulase with better features and conditions, and filamentous fungi have played an important role in the bioprocess, growing in liquid and solid cultures with sugarcane bagasse, corn stover and others lignocellulosic materials. In the present study, Agave atrovirens fibers were partially characterized, thermal pretreated and used as support, substrate and inducer source for cellulolytic complex production by four strains of the genus Trichoderma, where T. asperellum was selected as the best option for this process after evaluating the enzyme activity and the invasion capacity on the pretreated Agave fibers. Fungi were able to grow on the Agave fibers secreting the complex cellulolytic enzyme. Results show Agave fibers as a good carbon source and support for T. asperellum for the production of the cellulolytic complex (endoglucanase 12,860.8 U/g; exoglucanase 3144.4 U/g; and β-glucosidase 384.4 U/g). These results show the promising potential this material could have in the production of the active enzyme cellulase complex.



Introduction

The Agave, a native plant of Mexico, grows in desert and semi-desert areas. In 2012 the sown area in Mexico was about 137,626.27 ha and 19,876.07 Ha only were harvested, which gives a production of 1,686,337.41 t of Agave, with a price of 96 dollar/t (SIAP 2012). The main use of this crop is for beverages production, such as Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque, but this is only with some species like Tequiliana weber var azul and Angustifolia per example. A minority of these plants are used to make knitting yarns, paper and as limiting barrier in some areas; certain towns use the leaves to cook traditional Mexican dishes. As a result a large quantity of these plants have no use in the area. When the Agave flower appears it can reach 10 m high and after that the Agave plant dies, because this flower consumes all the disposable sugars present. So it is necessary to emphasize the importance in making use of the produced Agave crops that nowadays does not have a real use, though it could be used to obtain considerable amounts of fermentable sugars, oligosaccharides, composite and diverse materials, in addition to the alcoholic beverages.

To obtain many of these mentioned products, it is necessary to degrade the complex fibers of the Agave leaves.

The Agave cell wall composition is structured mainly by cellulose and hemicelluloses that can be hydrolyzed to simple sugars the action of fermentation. The third major component in the Agave cell wall is lignin, which has a negative effect in the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and is the main cause of the recalcitrance of the cell wall, that is the resistance of cell walls to be converted into fermentable sugars. The percentages of these three main components is variable between crops. For example, the cellulose percentage may vary from 65 to 85 between different species. The hemicellulose content could be from 3 up to 11 % in some species. And the lignin can be present in different species from 7 up to 16 % (Escamilla-Treviño 2012; Nava-Cruz et al. 2015).

Other important components of the cell wall in Agave plants, mainly in the leaves are the water-soluble carbohydrates, also called non-structural carbohydrates, which are released after thermal treatment. In some species, such as Agave tequiliana weber, these components can be present in 90 % of the dry matter (Mancilla-Margalli and Lopez 2006). In this kind of carbohydrates, fructans is the main component of the polymers. There is also present in this complex wall, the non-structural sugars, but these in much lower levels decreasing from the base to the top.

One of the most promising ways is the use of cellulases, which have the capacity to hydrolyze such leaves, resulting in fermentable sugars that can be used in different ways. For that reason the production of a cellulase complex using friendly ways that does not compromise all the factors involved is necessary. Cellulose is a polymer of glucose bound by β-1,4 linkages. But not all the cellulose materials have the same chain length and the level of interaction between chains (Cowling 1975). In waste cellulose between 40 and 60 % is cellulose, the rest are divided in hemicelluloses, lignins and other residual materials (Eveleight et al. 2009). The use of lignocellulosic materials for this objective is also increasing. These materials are cheap, abundant and renewable; all these features make the material appropriate to use as substrate in the fermentation process to produce cellulases (Maeda et al. 2011).

Nowadays, there is a crucial need to produce cellulases with better specifications and through natural materials and ways. Cellulases hold the third place worldwide in enzyme industry by dollar volume (Rani et al. 2010). This group of enzymes are formed by three single enzymes: endoglucanases, exoglucanases and β-glucosidases; the first ones hydrolyze the cellulose polymer exposing reductive and no reductive ends of the linear polymer of glucose, while the second ones attack these terminations to liberate cellobiose and cellooligosaccharides (Bansal et al. 2011; Deswal et al. 2011; Talebnia et al. 2010). The β-glucosidases (BGL) will join the cellobiose units to liberate finally the desired product, glucose (Sukuruman et al. 2009; Yah et al. 2010). Degradation process of cellulose consists of a six-step complicated process; the last one is a uniform catalysis process that includes participation of β-glucosidase on cellobiose (Chauve et al. 2010).

The interest in producing cellulases using new sources is increasing and new catalytic features are required. Several microorganisms capable of degrading the cellulosic material have been reported; actually there is a variety of studied microorganisms with special features such as aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (Gilkes et al. 1991; Kumar et al. 2004; Thirumale et al. 2001) soft and white rot fungi (Chung-Yi et al. 2009; Lo et al. 2010; Shrestha et al. 2009; Tanaka et al. 2009) and anaerobic fungi (Dashtban et al. 2009; Ljungdahl 2008). In some cases the cellulases are secreted as free molecules, like the example of filamentous fungi, actinomycetes and aerobic bacteria. The most used microorganisms to produce these kinds of lignocellulosic enzymes are filamentous fungi such as Trichoderma, Fusarium, Phanerochaete, Penicillium, etc. (Bak et al. 2009; de Siqueira et al. 2010; Javed et al. 2007; Lo et al. 2010; Mathew et al. 2008). The aim of this study was to produce cellulases in solid-state fermentation using as unique carbon source, inducer and support, Agave atrovirens fibers, by the action of a strain of Trichoderma spp.
