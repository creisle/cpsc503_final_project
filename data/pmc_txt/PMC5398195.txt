Antithrombin (AT) is a glycoprotein that inactivates the several physiological target enzymes of coagulation system. The effect of purification strategies plays a crucial role in getting maximum recovery of yield, purity and biological activity of recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT). In the present work, the task of purifying rhAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 has been carried out using two different approaches such as cross flow filtration (CFF) system and chromatography methods. In the first approach, the protein was concentrated and partially purified through CFF to achieve maximum recovery yield and purity of 87 and 94 %, respectively. In the second approach, purification involved a single step chromatography with various types of ion exchange and size exclusion resins to analyze the maximum rhAT recovery yield and purity. From the experimental results, it has been observed that the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) technique with Superose 12 matrix was suitable for the purification of rhAT and achieved the maximum recovery yield and purity of 51 and 97 %, respectively. Further, to acquire a high recovery yield and purity of rhAT, the effect of various chromatographic conditions such as mobile phase, mobile phase pH, flow rate, sample volume and sample concentration were also investigated. Under the optimal chromatographic conditions, rhAT was significantly recovered and purified in a single step with maximum recovery yield, purity and biological activity of 67, 99 % and 410 IU/L, respectively. Based on these investigations, it was concluded that SEC with Superose 12 matrix was a more suitable and a potential method for the purification of rhAT.



Introduction

Antithrombin (AT) is a plasma glycoprotein (432 amino acids) and a member of serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) family, which is an important physiological controller of various clotting factors, including thrombin, factor IXa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa (Rosenberg and Damus 1973; Franzen et al. 1980). The inactivation of thrombin by AT under normal physiological conditions is slow, but the rate of complex formation increases in a high degree by heparin cofactor activity (Machovich et al. 1976). AT has a therapeutic significance for those who suffer from venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with acquired or inherited inadequacy of AT activity (Beresford and Owen 1990). In these situations, an adequate supply of pure AT is essential.

Nevertheless, AT is available from human plasma (Büntemeyer et al. 1994; Munzert et al. 1997), from the view of product safety and possible virus infection (retrovirus and hepatotropic viruses), AT production must be only way through recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology (Zettlmeissl et al. 1987). AT has been produced using different expression systems like E. coli, Chinese hamster ovary cells and Pichia pastoris, COS 1 monkey kidney cells, BHK (baby hamster kidney) cells, Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells, and transgenic goat milk (Bock et al. 1982; Wasley et al. 1987; Zettlmeissl et al. 1988, 1989; Gillespie et al. 1991; Edmunds et al. 1998), but yeast-based recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT) has been demonstrated only by Broker et al..

To have the capacity to isolate a desired protein from a mixture, the physicochemical properties of the target protein should be used. Till now, there is no single or simple process to purify all kinds of proteins. On the other hand, if the protein is intended for clinical use, it ought to be very pure. But, as considered to be in economic view, purification should be done in a single step.

The main objective of a purification process is not only the exclusion of undesired contaminants, but also the purification of the target protein (Roe 2001). Ion exchange chromatography (IEC) is certainly the most commonly used technique for the separation and purification of proteins, polypeptides, nucleic acids, poly nucleotides, and other bio molecules. The explanations behind the accomplishment of IEC are its determining power, broad relevance, high capacity, and the effortlessness of the system (Bonnerjea et al. 1986). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is another purification process, in which components are filtered according to their size, and in some times molecular mass. It is frequently used to purify the larger or macro molecules such as proteins and industrial polymers (Paul-Dauphin et al. 2007).

In the present study, purification of rhAT from Sacharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 has been carried out using two different approaches such as cross flow filtration (CFF) and chromatography methods to achieve high recovery yields and purity. In addition, the effect of various physicochemical parameters such as mobile phase, mobile phase pH, flow rate, sample volume and sample concentration on rhAT purification were also investigated.
