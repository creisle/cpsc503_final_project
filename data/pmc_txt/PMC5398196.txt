The effects of major mineral salts, l-glutamine, myo-inositol and carbon source on shoot bud proliferation of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) cv. Mejhoul were evaluated. Different concentrations of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3; 550, 825 or 1650 mg/L), potassium nitrate (KNO3; 633.3, 950 or 1900 mg/L), calcium chloride dehydrate (CaCl2·2H2O; 147, 220 or 440 mg/L), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4; 57, 85 or 170 mg/L), magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O; 123, 185 or 370 mg/L), l-glutamine and myo-inositol (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 g/L), sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol or commercial granulated sugar (10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 g/L) were tested. The highest number of shoot buds per explant (18.7) occurred on the medium containing 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3, 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 170 mg/L KH2PO4, 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O as well as 1 g/L l-glutamine, 2 g/L myo-inositol and 30 g/L sucrose. The results showed that the frequency of hyperhydricity significantly increased in media containing 1650 mg/L NH4NO3. The concentrations of l-glutamine, myo-inositol and carbon source significantly affected the number of shoot buds per explant. However, they had no effect on hyperhydricity, tissue browning and precocious rooting. Shoots of 4.5–6.0 cm in length were isolated and transferred onto hormone-free media for elongation and rooting. After 3 months, the developed plantlets were successfully transplanted in a glasshouse and over 90 % survived acclimatization.



Introduction

Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is an agronomically, socioeconomically and ecologically important crop species in the Middle East and North Africa. The worldwide population of date palm trees is estimated to be around 150 million (Al-Khayri et al. 2015). In Morocco, date palm covers 50,000 ha with 5.4 million trees and 453 cultivars (Sedra 2015). Among these cultivars, cv. Mejhoul, also known as Medjool, Medjhool, Medjehuel and Mejhul (Elhoumaizi et al. 2006), is the most sought after and most famous cultivar worldwide (Sedra 2015). Mejhoul is also the most popular and most desired variety by the Moroccan farmers and consumers. Unfortunately, cv. Mejhoul is threatened by bayoud, a very dangerous disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. albedinis, which has decimated over 12 million palm trees (Saker 2011), and significantly decreased the population of cv. Mejhoul (Sedra 2011).

To preserve cv. Mejhoul from bayoud and to produce enough plants to satisfy the high demand of farmers and consumers, developing a large-scale propagation system then planting regenerants in bayoud-free areas is the only practical solution. Along this line, a micropropagation program through organogenesis was released in 2010 by the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, including cultivars of high fruit quality such as Najda, Boufeggous and Bouskri. The amount of plants of cv. Mejhoul aimed to be produced annually within this program is 67 % of the total amount of plants produced. However, micropropagation of date palm is genotype dependent (Jain 2012), and cv. Mejhoul is one of the most recalcitrant cultivars to in vitro manipulations. Therefore, developing an efficient regeneration system through organogenesis for this cultivar would require a high optimization of media components and culture conditions.

Studies on date palm micropropagation through organogenesis are scarce. In the past few years, regeneration systems through this technique were reported in some cultivars; e.g., cv. Maktoom (Khierallah and Bader 2007), cv. Dhakki (Khan and Bi Bi 2012), cv. Hillawi (Al-Mayahi 2014) and cv. Boufeggous (Mazri 2015). However, the majority of works focused on the effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs). The effects of other factors such as mineral salts, l-glutamine, myo-inositol and carbon source have been scarcely evaluated for date palm organogenesis (Al-Khateeb 2008a; Mazri 2013, 2014; Mazri and Meziani 2013).

Major mineral salts (macronutrients) are inorganic elements needed in relatively large amounts for healthy and vigorous growth of plants (George and de Klerk 2008). Carbohydrates are essential elements for in vitro propagation of plants (Thorpe et al. 2008). They are employed as a source of energy and as an osmotic agent (Thorpe et al. 2008), and to replace the carbon which is normally fixed by plants from the atmosphere by photosynthesis (George and de Klerk 2008). The mineral and carbohydrate requirements for shoot bud proliferation of date palm seem to depend on the genotype used. With regard to l-glutamine and myo-inositol, their effects on date palm organogenesis have never been evaluated. l-Glutamine is an amino acid known for promoting and maintaining cell function (Newsholme et al. 2003). It has been used to promote somatic embryo proliferation, maturation and germination of many plant species, including date palm (Encina et al. 2014; Kim and Moon 2007; Zouine and El Hadrami 2007; Zouine et al. 2005). Myo-inositol is a vitamin that promotes cell and protoplast division (Bellini et al. 1990; Kim et al. 2003; Kiviharju et al. 2005), as well as callus growth (Sepehr and Ghorbanli 2002).

The success of date palm organogenesis is hampered by some physiological disorders: hyperhydricity, a morphological anomaly in which explants are glassy, water soaked and translucent (Debergh et al. 1992); tissue browning, which occurs due to the high levels of caffeoylshikimic acids contained in date palm tissues (Loutfi and El Hadrami 2005); and precocious rooting of organogenic cultures, which decreases bud formation (Al-Khateeb 2008b). The composition of the culture medium affects the incidence of these physiological disorders. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account their occurrence during the optimization of the culture medium.

The purpose of this investigation was to optimize the concentrations of mineral salts, l-glutamine, myo-inositol and carbon source for a rapid and efficient shoot bud multiplication of the recalcitrant date palm cultivar Mejhoul and to examine their effects on the incidence of hyperhydricity, tissue browning and precocious rooting. Accordingly, a total of 70 different culture media were evaluated.
