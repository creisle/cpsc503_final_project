
Abstract

Bioflocculants are secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms during their growth which have received attentions due to their biodegradability, innocuousness and lack of secondary pollution from degradation intermediates. This study reports on a bioflocculant produced by Bacillus specie isolated from Thyume River in South Africa. The bacterial isolate was identified through 16S rDNA sequencing and the BLAST analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed 99% similarity to Bacillus sp. BCT-7112. The sequence was subsequently deposited in the GenBank as Bacillus sp. AEMREG4 with accession number KP406729. The optimum culture conditions for bioflocculant production were an inoculum size 4% (v/v) (80%) and starch (81%) as well as yeast extract (82%) as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. Addition of Ca2+ greatly enhanced the flocculating activity (76%) of crude bioflocculant over a wide range of pH 4–10 and retained high flocculating activity when heated at 100 °C for 1 h. Chemical analyses of the purified bioflocculant revealed carbohydrate (79% w/w) as a predominant component followed by uronic acid (15% w/w) and protein (5% w/w). Fourier transform infrared spectrum revealed the presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl and methoxyl groups as the functional groups responsible for flocculation and the high flocculation activity achieved portends its industrial applicability.



Introduction

Flocculants are substances of either synthetic or natural origin used as sedimentation aids to bring about the solid–liquid separations by the process of flocculation (Lachhwani 2005). They are conventionally used in different industrial processes such as water treatment, downstream processing in fermentation processes and mineral ore treatment in metallurgical industries (Nwodo et al. 2013). Flocculants can either be cationic or anionic with respect to charge and they also exhibit a wide range of the molecular weights (Salehizadeh and Shojaosadati 2001). However, their setbacks include the hazard impose to human health such as neurotoxicity and carcinogenicity in humans (Dearfield et al. 1988). It has also been reported that aluminium, the main constituent of polyaluminum may lead to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (Arezoo 2002). Chemical flocculants such as polyacrylamides have also been reported to be recalcitrant to degradation (Mabinya et al. 2011; Piyo et al. 2011). Hence, the need for better alternatives that are safe and environmentally friendly and bioflocculants appear to be an important candidate to fill in the gap (Cosa et al. 2011).

Previous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of bioflocculants in the removal of humic acids, treatment of dye solutions, wastewater treatment and the removal of metal ions from aqueous solution (Salehizadeh and Shojaosadati 2003; Zouboulis et al. 2004; Deng et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2009). However, high production costs accompanied by low yield have been the major drawbacks to large-scale production for industrial applications; thus, prompting the need for new microorganisms with enhanced bioflocculant-producing capability that justify the production costs. In this paper, we report on the flocculating potential of a bioflocculant produced by Bacillus sp. AEMREG4 isolated from water samples from Tyhume River in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.
