
Abstract

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNA of approximately 22 nt in length. They are considered as key regulators for gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play an important role in the regulation of many fundamental biological processes. Andrias davidianus, as one of the largest amphibian on earth, may represent the transitional type of animal from aquatic to terrestrial life, but so far, no miRNA has been identified in the species. In this study, Illumina deep sequencing was used for high-throughput analysis of miRNAs in a pooled small RNA library isolated from eight tissues sample of A. davidianus including the spleen, liver, muscle, kidney, skin, testis, gut, and heart. In total, 6,213,146 reads were obtained, 5,962,175 of which were related to 143 unique miRNAs, including 140 conserved and three novel A. davidianus-specific miRNAs. Among them, seven conserved miRNAs and one novel miRNA were selected to validate their expression pattern by stem-loop qRT-PCR. Moreover, 4700 potential target genes were predicted for 143 A. davidianus miRNAs; GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway showed that most of the targets are involved in diverse biological processes including ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, FOXO signaling pathway, tight junction, and spliceosome. This study provides the first large-scale identification and characterization of A. davidianus miRNAs, and predicted their potential target genes; it will lay a valuable foundation for future understanding the role of these miRNAs on regulating diverse biological processes.

Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of genome-encoded small RNAs with approximately 22 nt in length, that are abundant in nearly all metazoans, plant, fungi, protists, and even in viruses (Lin et al. 2009; Li et al. 2010b; Sun et al. 2012; Mu et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2016; Huang and Evans 2016). Biogenesis of miRNAs, in general, starts from the transcription of pri-miRNAs by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus, which are cleaved by Drosha to produce 60â€“80 nt-long stem-loop pre-miRNAs (Lee et al. 2004). Subsequently, pre-miRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5 protein and cleaved by another RNase enzyme (Dicer) to generate ~22 nucleotide double-stranded mature miRNAs (Bartel 2004). One of the two strands of the miRNA will be assembled with the RNA-induced silencing complex. These mature miRNAs can regulate the expression of target genes by binding to the coding regions or untranslated regions (Siomi and Siomi 2010). It has been estimated that they may target up to 30% of protein-coding genes in animals. Each miRNA may have multiple gene targets, and each gene target may also be regulated by more than one miRNA (Wen et al. 2012). Growing evidences indicate that miRNAs act as key regulators of genes which involved in the regulation of multiple biological processes such as tissue development, cellular proliferation and differentiation, immune response, gametogenesis, metastasis, signal transduction, and oncogenesis (Hobert 2008; Huang et al. 2011; Rateitschak et al. 2016; Sachdeva et al. 2016).

The Chinese giant salamander (A. davidianus) is the largest extant amphibian in the world (Murphy et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2016). Now, it is classified as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Nature Resources, and is the class II state major protection species in China. In the evolution history of vertebrates, the Chinese giant salamander occupies a seat at the phylogenetic and species evolution process which is representing a transitional form that links the aquatic animals to terrestrial organisms. Therefore, this species has an important scientific value. Over the past a few years, thousands of miRNAs had been identified through the application of direct clone, computational prediction, and deep sequencing technologies, and more than 28,645 miRNAs were annotated in miRBase database release 21.0 in June 2014 (http://www.mirbase.org/). However, little is known about the miRNA of A. davidianus. Currently, deep sequencing has become a powerful approach for high-throughput gene identification on a genome-wide scale in non-model organisms; it has an important advantage and can detect almost all small RNA such as known and novel miRNAs even with extremely low abundance (Hallman et al. 2013). In this study, we performed the first deep sequencing study of the miRNA population in A. davidianus, and identified 143 miRNAs, and predicted their gene targets; this information will be helpful for understanding of miRNA populations in A. davidianus, and lay a solid foundation for further functional studies of these miRNAs.
