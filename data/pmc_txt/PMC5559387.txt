
Abstract

The present study documents a simultaneous production and comparative assessment of extracted vasicinone from in vivo (leaves and stems) and in vitro (leaves, stems and calli) plant parts of Adhatoda vasica Nees, a well-known medicinal plant. High-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of the above-mentioned plant parts, collected at their 60-day-old growth stage, was performed via methanolic extraction and with the aid of toluene:butanol:butyl acetate (9:0.5:0.5; v/v/v) solvent system. The method was validated with the help of aluminium sheet precoated with silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates, following the ICH guidelines in order to maintain accuracy, precision and repeatability. Correlation coefficient, limit of detection and limit of quantification values were found to be reasonable. The outcome revealed a linearity that ranged between 2 and 6 µg/spot. During the comparison of estimated vasicinone quantity from in vivo and in vitro plant parts, it was evident that in vitro samples produced relatively higher vasicinone than that of the in vivo counterparts. Maximum vasicinone (6.402 ± 0.010% of dry weight) production was quantified from in vitro leaves followed by calli (5.222 ± 0.092% of dry weight) and in vitro stems (2.007 ± 0.041% of dry weight). On the other hand, in vivo leaves and stems produced comparatively lower quantities of vasicinone (2.412 ± 0.139 and 1.933 ± 0.046% of dry weight, respectively) suggesting the in vitro clonal propagation as a superior approach in comparison to in vivo propagation. Nonetheless, simultaneous production from both the sources (in vivo and in vitro plant parts) provides a new avenue for augmented production of vasicinone.



Introduction

Adhatoda vasica Nees (syn, Justicia adhatoda L.), commonly known as Malabar Nut (or Vasaka) is a perennial shrub and belongs to the family Acanthaceae. It grows in sub-Himalayan tracts and has conventionally been utilized in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine for more than 2000 years (Jayapaul et al. 2005). It is basically an evergreen shrub of 1–2.5 m height with opposite ascending branches producing a vile smell and bitter taste. Several ethnopharmacological studies on A. vasica reported the aerial portions of the plant (like stem, leaf, flower, fruit and seeds) to contain vasicine, vasicinone (Suthar et al. 2009), vasicine acetate and 2-acetyl benzyl amine (Ignacimuthus and Shanmugam 2010), adhatodine and vasicoline (Ahmad et al. 2009). A. vasica leaves and stems have been utilized as a herbal medication for allergen-induced respiratory diseases, rheumatism, malarial fever, gastrointestinal disorders, haemorrhage, skin diseases and many other ailments, occurring in countries like India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (reviewed by Claeson et al. 2000). A. vasica has been included in the WHO manual for health workers in Southeast Asia owing to its recurrent usage, conveniently devoid of any serious side effects (World Health Organization 1990). Vasicinone, the central autooxidation by-product of vasicine, has been documented to exhibit bronchodilatory, cardiac-stimulating and anti-anaphylactic effects (Bhide et al. 1976; Shinawie 2002). One of the commercial produces of A. vasica is Adulsa, a cough syrup (Roja et al. 2011). There is a significant requirement of A. vasica-based drugs in the Indian subcontinent and this demand is being satisfied from the natural plant population so far. Inaptly, seed germination rate of A. vasica is poor and traditional propagation through vegetative approach is inadequate (Mathew et al. 1998), which prompts significant depletion of the source of pharmaceutically important metabolites like vasicinone. This existing scenario calls for an alternative approach in the form of in vitro propagation that could complement the traditional system of propagation, and crop up as a better source for secondary metabolites extraction. Nowadays plant organ, tissue and cell culture system have been exhaustively explored as a substitute for the production of secondary metabolites, avoiding any loss in natural plant population in majority of the medicinal plant species (Ramachandra Rao and Ravishankar 2002; Komaraiah et al. 2003; Gantait et al. 2011). Yet, the comparative assessment of secondary metabolite among in vitro and in vivo plant parts is of utmost importance from an economic viewpoint; however, such study has been attempted only once (Garg et al. 2016) in A. vasica, to the best of our knowledge. The propagation conditions (in vitro or in vivo) assisting the accumulation of high concentration of vasicinone in A. vasica are undetermined as well.

Earlier reported techniques for the vasicinone quantification comprises high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) (Avula et al. 2008), reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) (Garg et al. 2016), and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (UHPLC–ESI/MS/MS) (Singh et al. 2016), along with high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) as well. Presently, HPTLC is being widely used for its systematic method validation, consistency in the quantification of analytes (precisely in nanogram levels) and cost effectiveness. The prime benefit of HPTLC is curtailment of time and cost per analysis (Dharmender et al. 2010). Effective use of HPTLC has been well documented in some major economically important medicinal plants for their respective secondary metabolite assay (Gantait et al. 2011; Swain et al. 2012; Varghese et al. 2013; Bala et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2016; Shuayprom et al. 2016), but only three reports are available on vasicinone quantification from in vivo plant samples of A. vasica (Das et al. 2005; Suthar et al. 2009; Roja et al. 2011) with none on comparative quantification (between in vivo and in vitro plant parts) of vasicinone.

The present study was therefore focused on the simultaneous production and relative assessment of vasicinone through HPTLC from both the in vivo and in vitro plant parts of A. vasica, and optimizing the major sink of accumulation.
