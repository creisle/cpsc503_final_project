
Abstract

Two sgRNAs were designed to target the region of exon 2 of the pULBP1 gene by microinjection. The co-injection of modified Cas9-D10A nickase with a pair of sgRNAs into the zygote’s cytoplasm easily and efficiently generated biallelic modification of the pULBP1 gene in one step. Five out of nine F0 generation piglets showed insertions or deletions in the targeting site of the pULBP1 gene, indicating that pULBP1 mutation efficiency reached about 56% (5/9). Quantitative determination of pULBP1 showed approximately a 1.53-fold reduction in the amount of protein ULBP1 on the cell surface (ELISA). A human NK-cell cytotoxicity test leads to the conclusion that higher cell viability is observed for −/− ULBP1 (survival rate 85.36%) compared to +/+ ULBP1 (69.58%). ULBP1-KO pigs will provide a more progressive xenograft source for further research studies, especially those measuring the effects of abolishing the gene function in terms of the complexity of the immunological interactions.



Introduction

A donor shortage is the main limitation for conducting transplantations to save patients or improve their quality of life by treating severe organ failure. Despite improvements in the organ registration and distribution systems, in reduced toxicity of immunosuppressive treatments and even in education by means of social campaigns increasing the number of cadaveric and living donors, the gap between the number of organs available and demand must be filled. The challenges in cross-species transplantation have been considered for at least 300 years (Cooper 2012). Non-human primates (NHPs) representing phylogenetically concordant species to humans are consequently being excluded, because their medical utility provides both strong ethical resistance and transmission of xenozoonoze threats. Numerous attributes support the use of discordant pigs to meet the shortfall in organs. At the same time, the large phylogenetic distance casts a shadow over pig-to-human xenotransplantation. The organs from non-genetically engineered pigs (wild-type) are useless for medical applications because of massed antibody- and complement-mediated rejection (Cooper et al. 2016). The cells of grafted organs encounter xenorejection triggered by different types of immunological response. Hyperacute rejection (HAR) resulting in a procoagulant phenotype of swine endothelium leads to thrombosis and immediate (within minutes) loss of organ function (Pierson et al. 2009). The main cause of hyperacute rejection is an antigen present in the glycolipids and glycoproteins of the endothelial cells surface of pigs (not present in humans nor in NHPs). Carbohydrate residue Galα1,3Galβ-R (αGal) synthesis is catalysed by α1,3-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GT, EC2.4.1.151) and results from adding galactose residue to N-acetyllactosamine. Another significant problem is the incompatibility of porcine complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) on donor endothelium with the human complement, which results in uncontrolled complement activation. HAR silencing by immunosuppressive therapies and the organs from genetically modified pigs with α1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout (GTKO) or/and expressing human α1,2-fucosyltransferase (hHT), or/and galactosidase (GLA), or/and expressing human complement regulatory proteins (hCRPs) will also reveal cellular and/or humoral epiphenomena causing delayed responses, including xenograft rejection (DXR), also called acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHXR) (Cooper 2012, Puga Yung et al. 2017). Acute vascular rejection (AVR) is induced by xenoreactive antibodies directed against the endothelium of blood vessels and partially by complement activation. Endothelium–xenoantibody interactions induce the production of interleukin IL-1α, which stimulates tissue factor, plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), E-selectin and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) secretion, and small amounts of complement or platelets, leading to vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and inflammation, which are characteristic of AVR. At the same time, endothelial cells are lost by apoptosis, limiting the availability of nitric oxide (NO) (Cascalho and Platt 2001). Small genetic differences found between the recipient and the donor of the transplanted organ may also lead to a disturbance in the equilibrium in proanticoagulant–anticoagulant activity of the coagulation system, which subsequently triggers xenograft rejection (Boksa et al. 2015). Coagulation dysregulation can result in thrombotic microangiopathy, causing thrombus occlusion of organ vasculature, leading to ischemic necrosis (Cooper et al. 2015). Vascularized grafts are lost because of AHXR characterized by transcriptional endothelial cell activation, thrombosis with fibrin deposition, and infiltration by innate immune cells (natural killer cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils) (Rieben and Seebach 2005, Cooper et al. 2015). Pig organs ex vivo perfused with human blood are infiltrated by NK cells (Lilienfeld et al. 2006). Activated NK cells are capable of destroying the xenografts by direct cytotoxic effect regulated by the predominance of positive (activating lytic mechanisms) or negative (inhibiting reaction) signals or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). UL16-binding protein 1 (pULBP1) on porcine endothelium cells was shown to be the main functional ligand for the C-type lectin human NKG2D receptor on NK cells (Lilienfeld et al. 2006). The elimination of potential porcine ligands for receptors activating NK cells and, on the other hand, increasing the number of ligands for inhibitory receptors might prevent xenograft rejection involving NK cells. According to Pierson et al., strategies to overcome NK-cell activity also include human MHC class I molecules expression on the surface of swine endothelium and blocking of molecular events leading to NK recruitment (Pierson et al. 2009).

Fourteen years ago, when the first piglets with the biallelic KO phenotype of GGTA1 were born at PPL Therapeutics, molecular techniques were limited. Since then, new technologies involving zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and RNA-guided endonucleases (CRISPR) have evolved. CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) adaptive immune systems constitute a bacterial defense against invading nucleic acids derived from bacteriophages/plasmids. Single-guide sgRNAs hybridize and form a complex with Cas9 nuclease, which recognizes and cleaves genetic material. Imperfect repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) results in the modification of the targeted site. Techniques based on CRISPR-Cas9 are simple and quick tools for genome editing, also adapted to create modified pigs for xenotransplantation. In this study, we present a generation of pigs with pULBP1 gene modified by CRISPR-Cas9 and their potential use as donors in xenotransplantation.
