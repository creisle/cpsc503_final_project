Hand-manufacturing of a prosthetic implant can only be carried out if the original cranial bone fragment is available. Since the cases treated at our Hospital presented with fragmented cranial fractures, bone preservation was implausible.

PMMA prosthesis manufacturing by hand has been used since 1970 using various processes [1, 16–18], but these methods have been overtaken by computer assisted design and manufacturing techniques (CAD/CAM) which consist on using images of the cranial defect and manufacturing the PMMA prostheses with a 3D printer [19–25]. The CAD/CAM technique described by Caro-Osorio & Cols. in 2013 is no longer an expensive method. The ideal implant material should have the following characteristics: it should be able to adjust to the cranial defect, it must achieve a full defect coverage, full biocompatibility, inertness, non-thermal conductor, radiolucent, non-magnetic, light, rigid, easily placed and low-cost .

A titanium prosthesis is more difficult to manufacture than one made from PMMA . Even though, as Park and cols. have commented, postoperative patients treated with a titanium implant have a satisfactory postoperative course evaluated with CTs, documenting an adequate implant fixation and cranial symmetry, the main obstacle with this technique is cost.

Preoperative prosthesis manufacturing is simpler, technically speaking, and has the added advantage of lowering surgical time, blood loss and infection rate, and improving the aesthetic result satisfaction when compared to intraoperative moulding .

PMMA preoperative implant manufacturing can be done either by hand or with CAD/CAM techniques. Manufacturing done by hand is cheaper and less time consuming than using a patient’s 3D-CT data to then print a 3D implant . Nevertheless, this last method has recently gained popularity because it does not require to be tried on the bone defect to produce excellent cosmetic results .

Pre-operative production (ie. prefabrication) of a cranioplasty prosthesis involves a computer-aided design system and direct computer-aided manufacturing to obtain the desired shape. This system uses standard 3D CT data.

It is done by locating the cranial defect margin on a skull surface image generated from a 3D head CT-scan. A right-to-left mirrored image or an average 3D skull surface template image is then fitted to the patient’s skull surface image. The area around the defect is cut out and stitched to the previously isolated defect margin. This defect-filling surface is then tapered and printed out in 3D. The 3D print implant model is then recasted in a biocompatible material .

The process differs from ours in that the delineation and the stabilization of the skull defect margin are not required to identify the thickness and the shape of the implant piece. We use the Boolean operation of extraction exclusively between the mirrored side and the side with the defect to obtain the implant piece with the shape and the thickness required.

No complications were observed in either of the cases reviewed in this article, but the population cannot be presumed to be of any statistical significance. Thien A. and cols. reported in 2015 a 25% tendency in incidence towards titanium prosthesis exposition in contrast to a 12.5% incidence with PEEK. These authors also mentioned that infection rate in patients undergoing decompressive craniotomy was associated with previous cranioplasties . It is evident after reviewing the literature that there is no perfect prosthetic material for cranioplasties free from complications.

The results observed in our cases match the reports from Akam M. and cols. who concluded that polymethyl methacrylate is a low-cost, long-lasting material which can be used to reconstruct full thickness cranial defects.
