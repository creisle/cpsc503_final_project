The past decade has seen remarkable growth in the use of 3D printing in medicine. The growth has been fueled by the development of high resolution imaging studies merging with the rapid development of 3D printing technologies, and the development of new printing materials. These advances have resulted in reductions in the costs associated with creating high resolution medical models. The evolution of this disruptive technology is expected to revolutionize medical practice.

While much attention has been focused on the application of 3D printing in medicine, less attention has been given to ensuring that the 3D printed model is a true and accurate representation of the physical object under study. If this technology is to be widely integrated into advanced medical practices, ensuring the physical accuracy and reproducibility of 3D models by means of a comprehensive QA program is essential.

This work addresses these concerns by providing the necessary framework for developing and maintaining a QA program for 3D printing. Incorporation of existing imaging quality procedures forms the foundation for the program. It begins with acquisition of high quality imaging data using ACR accredited personnel and machines. Accuracy of segmentation by trained staff and awareness of the impact of processing STL files is the second step in the program. Verification and validation of the 3D printing process including phantom testing and model analysis is the third step. Unique identification of models along with documentation in patient medical record is also an important part of the process. The QA program delineated in this work thus describes an end-to-end testing of the entire 3D printing process.

Among the three major steps in 3D printing: imaging, segmentation, and printing; the segmentation step is the most challenging with regards to QA. Significant effort was reported investigating accuracy when printing boney anatomy, with scanning bone in air, water and in situ with subsequent removal of soft tissues to reveal bone dimensions to perform the comparison [33â€“36]. The accuracy of segmenting highly depends on the image quality, such as spatial resolution and contrast to noise ratio. For models scanned in air, such as the QA phantom or the printed model, the segmentation is relatively easy given the high contrast between the model and the air background. It becomes much more challenging for patient cases, especially for segmentation of different types of soft tissues with low contrast. Therefore, it is essential to check for accuracy of the segmentation before printing. We recommend checking the overlaps between final STL files and the original source images. Medical knowledge about anatomy and pathology is required to judge the accuracy of segmentation. Work presented here represents early and simple approaches. Further development on objective, quantitative and time-effective QA method in segmentation is desired.

Phantoms are critical for the QA process. Two generations of QA phantoms have been developed and used in this study. A similar QA process and testing phantom like the first generation QA phantom can be easily developed by those starting a 3D medical modeling program. In this way, experience and expertise can be gained without creating too complex of a QA program which may absorb limited resources and personnel. However, the 2nd generation phantom has more test objects and shapes which can more comprehensively test all facets of the 3D printing process.

One of the validation methods presented in this study was to scan a printed model and compare with the initial segmentation. This method works well to evaluate the total shape of the printed model, but challenges exist to evaluate internal structures of models with multiple components. For models with multiple components, materials with different HU values should be carefully selected to represent different components. The HU range of available printing materials could be a limiting factor in this approach . The alignment of the source STL and that resulting from scanning the printed model could be potentially difficult in certain scenarios. Although automatic alignment tools exist in some software, the accuracy of the alignment should be carefully evaluated and manual adjustment may be needed. Misalignment will result in errors in the evaluation of agreement. Also, appropriate imaging modality and imaging protocols should be used. High resolution, high geometric accuracy, low noise, and artifact-free imaging method should be used to avoid additional errors introduced by the imaging process in alignment and measurement. This method also has challenges for models built with flexible materials. Since these models may deform after being printed, it is not an easy task to ensure that the model maintains its original shape during the scan. For this scenario, it is helpful to build some supporting structures while building the model to support the model in order to have it retain the original shape it has in the patient. This way, the same method can be used. Given these potential limitations, this method should be carefully evaluated for the specific applications before used as a routine QA process.

There are several limitations to this work. First, the protocols are based on experience with a single type of 3D printer and with segmentation software from a single vendor. The general framework and concepts of this QA program, though, can be extended to other types of printers with appropriate adjustments made according to the specific printing technology and to type of segmentation software. Secondly, our experience relies heavily on the use of CT imaging data which is used for the majority of our models as CT provide high spatial resolution and high geometric accuracy, both of which are critical for 3D printed models used in medicine. However, general principles outlined in this paper apply to 3D printing using other imaging modalities too. MRI data is increasing used as an adjunct to the CT data as higher resolution MRI imaging sequences are being developed. The use of 3D Ultrasound data is still in early stages of exploration for 3D printing. Finally, the QA program does not provide specific and quantifiable standard for 3D printing. As this technology evolves substantial QA data from multiple institutions needs to be accumulated over time so that appropriate specific and quantifiable QA standard will be developed and adopted by the medical 3D printing community.
