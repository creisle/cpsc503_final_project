
Abstract

This study, for the first time, evaluates the efficiency of castor oil when used as an external coating on Capsicum annuum L., to increase postharvest storage-life at 4 ± 1 °C. The castor oil-coated fruits were successfully stored for 36 days, while the non-coated fruits could only sustain for 18 days. Throughout the storage period (at 9-day intervals), different antioxidants and biochemical assays (allied with storage) such as titratable acidity, ascorbic acid content, ferrous ion chelating activity, reducing power, DPPH scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, total phenolic content, total sugar estimation, and enzymatic study of polyphenol oxidase and pectate lyase, were assessed. During storage, the castor oil-coated fruits showed a substantial decrease in titratable acidity, ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content, including antioxidant activities such as reducing power and DPPH activity; however, an increase in ferrous ion chelating activity, total soluble sugar content, polyphenol oxidase activity and initial pectate lyase activity was observed, in contrast to that of the non-coated fruits. The application of castor oil proved to be effective in delaying the ripening process of fruits during storage.



Introduction

Capsicum annuum L. (green chilli), an important member of Solanaceae family, is mainly grown as a cash crop owing to its distinctly pungent non-climacteric fruits, enriched with vitamins and minerals. Inspite of having such high nutritional values it has limited storage-life (Panigrahi et al. 2017), which is a major problem for fruits and vegetable growers. Following its harvest, the fruits undergo gradual deterioration due to desiccation, oxidative reactions, microbial growth, and other biochemical changes. Such rapid deterioration in the form of softening, wrinkling, wilting and decaying of the harvested produce during storage and transportation, fail to provide the anticipated profit, consumer-acceptance or to even meet the actual cultivation cost. Softening of fruits is directly linked with water loss during storage (Lownds et al. 1994; Rao and Shivashankara 2015).

Herein, external coating(s), acting as partial barrier to water vapour, gases and restricting rapid metabolism, might be helpful to preserve the texture, quality and external appearance of harversted fruits, and in due course may also improve their storage-life, significantly influencing the functions of storage-associated biochemicals and antioxidants (Baldwin 1994; Li et al. 2017; Panigrahi et al. 2017). External coatings comprise hydrophobics (lipids or waxes), hydrocolloids (polysaccharides or proteins) or a combination of both the compounds (composite coatings). The coating composition determines the barrier properties of the material with respect to water vapour, oxygen, carbon dioxide and lipid transfer in food systems (Guilbert et al. 1996). Even though hydrophilic coatings function as excellent carbon dioxide and oil barriers and provide strength and structural integrity to the fruits, however, they are not at all effective moisture barriers and can create adverse anaerobic conditions (McHugh and Krochta 1994). Hydrophobic lipid or oil coatings have good water vapour barrier properties, due to their low polarity (Guilbert et al. 1996). Usually, climacteric fruits like green peppers do not show any detectable changes in respiration rates during storage (Conforti and Zinck 2002). However, it was recorded that when cucumber and bell pepper were exogenously coated with chitosan, the rate of respiration noticably reduced (Ghaouth et al. 1991). Furthermore, Wong et al. reported that when cut apple pieces were treated with multilayer coatings, it aided in maintaining the internal carbon dioxide concentrations.

Castor oil is an important vegetable oil with a rich source of ricinoleic acid, a mono-unsaturated, 18-carbon fatty acid. Ricinoleic acid amid all the other fatty acids, is exceptional since it includes a hydroxyl group on its twelfth carbon; it is for the virtue of this functional group that ricinoleic acid (and castor oil) is more polar than the other fats (Thomas 2012). Castor oil proved to be efficient with its greater resistance to increased CO2 and reduced O2 in the internal environ of fruits, in comparison to that of the essential oils or mineral oils. Castor oil coating significantly delayed the softening and retained the flavour in fruits (Baldwin 1994). Owing to such property, the castor oil coating on seeds of edible pulse or oilseed crops is being used traditionally, to extend the storage life since long, in the southern districts of Gujarat State, India (Parmar and Jain 2016). There are several reports on postharvest storage-life of C. annuum published till date that include semperfresh edible coating (Özden and Bayindirli 2002), shellac-based surface coating (Chitravathi et al. 2014), essential oil (cinnamon) coating (Ali et al. 2014), and gibberellic acid coating (Panigrahi et al. 2017).

However, there is no report that addresses the efficacy of castor oil as a coating to slow down the postharvest ripening process till date. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated the influence of castor oil as an external coating on different storage-associated biochemical and antioxidant activities with the aim to extend the postharvest storage-life of C. annuum L.
