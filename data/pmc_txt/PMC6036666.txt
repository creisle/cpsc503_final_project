In this study we demonstrated the use of various metal artifact reduction techniques in order to enhance the anatomical 3D segmentation hampered by heavy metal artifacts. In addition we showed that using dedicated iterative metal artifact reduction algorithm is the most promising technique to reduce the metal artifact volume and hence reducing segmentation time. Those findings are important, since a majority of head-and-neck CT acquisitions are associated with metal artifacts due to dental restorations. This results in laborious 3D segmentation of the craniomaxillofacial bones and separation of the mandible from the maxilla which is needed when 3D printing clinical cases. Previous studies evaluating metal artifact reduction techniques mainly focused on the diagnostic performance and our observations made in the phantom and patient studies agreed with the findings in the present literature [15, 17–19].

Bannas et al. showed an incremental value of gantry tilt on the reader’s sensitivity of detecting oral tumors as gantry tilt redistributed the metal artifacts to other locations outside of the slices where the tumor was . Our phantom data support the visual results, however quantitatively the segmented artifact volume was not different between both gantry states. Artifact segmentation time of the data in non-tilted position was shorter as the artifact did not have to be removed from as many slices. This is mainly due to the concentration of artifact in a smaller and more condensed volume, resulting in a faster and simplified containment. In clinical practice, if the sole purpose of the CT exams is for 3D modeling, patients should be scanned without gantry tilt, as demonstrated by our phantom data. However, if the scan is for both 3D printing and other diagnostic tasks (e.g. tumor detection) where gantry tilt benefits the diagnosis, the patients should be scanned with gantry tilt. In this case, the benefit of accurate tumor detection outweighs the drawback of increased processing time for 3D modeling. Dedicated MAR technique should be used, which has been shown to have a positive impact for the clinical evaluation and 3D-segmentation.

The use of a jaw spacer has been recommended for maxillofacial CT-acquisitions in order to separate both jaws . Our data support the recommendations without having any effects on the segmented artifact volumes. Clinically many of our 3D printed craniomaxillofacial cases are for tumor resection or congenital facial reconstruction and the surgeon often requests the mandible be printed separately from the maxilla for surgical planning. This requires two separate volumes to be created which is hampered by overlapping artifact which is greatly reduced with the jaw spacer. A separate benefit of the spacer was more realistic appearance to the teeth after segmentation. The most time and labor effective artifact reduction method in both phantom and patient model is the dedicated iterative metal artifact reduction . Our study hence adds to the current literature stating that the use of this technique enhances the 3D-segmentation workflow. As demonstrated in a previous study, the MAR algorithm can occasionally deteriorate the bone contours if the parameter settings were not optimal . Therefore, caution should be taken using MAR algorithm and bone contour should be carefully checked based on professional expertise during the segmentation process.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, our patient sample size is very small, since the number of patients referred for pre-operative 3D-printing was limited. Secondly, the phantom used was made of acrylic, which has lower attenuation than bone and consistent CT number unlike the bone which is more variable. In this study, we lowered the CT number threshold in the segmentation process to accommodate this difference between the material properties. This procedure, however, was not necessary in the human subject studies. As seen in our patient study, substantial improvement of image quality was achieved with real bones. Another limitation is that the model after thresholding and manually alteration was used as the reference model when artifact volume was calculated. Since this process was done separately for images reconstructed with and without MAR, it is possible there are slight differences in the artifact volume based on manual artifact removal. Building a common reference model with other techniques, such as 3D scanning, may provide a more accurate estimation of artifact volume. However, we expect the difference would be small as the radiologist tried to maintain the same anatomy after artifact removal and carefully reviewed the final data before calculating artifact volume.
