The examples of models presented here all are vast improvements to 2D pictures when trying to convey complex biological concepts. However, none of these models are perfect. 3D printing is a continually improving technology. As more individual techniques to 3D print objects are developed and as existing techniques are refined, the quality of models produced will continue to improve.

There are specific improvements to existing 3D printing techniques that will benefit the generation of physical models like the ones presented here. A printer capable of printing different colors within a clear plastic material would make a model of the prevacuolar compartment more accurate. Also, the capability to produce models of objects in free space would make some of these models more useful. This is especially true in the case of the prevacuolar compartment and of the distal tip cell. Finally, as the feature resolution and strength of available materials advance, the overall quality of the models will improve.

The future of 3D printing and microcopy has a lot of potential and room for growth. Despite the success of the 3D printed models shown here, the technology, both in model creation and in model fabrication, still can struggle to match the spatial and temporal resolution of a dynamic 3D dataset. In this presented work we chose to work mostly with relatively straightforward 3D datasets. But many investigators want to show multiple models of a process changing over time for research and educational purposes. It can be costly to make the multiple models needed to capture an entire process and difficult to represent fine or floating details in intricate processes. 3D datasets that do not have clear spatial boundaries can also be difficult to reproduce faithfully.

The 3D electron tomography model of the prevacuolar compartment presented in this paper nicely illustrates these issues. In this case, the data on screen can sometimes better show the features of interest as you can see the components more clearly as you rotate virtually, while some of that perspective is lost in the printed model. This is especially true when examining processes that happen over time, such as protein trafficking in this case, where the components are more in free space and can get left out of a printed model. And if included, they would only represent one snapshot of a process that is dynamic. As more 3D modeling, 3D printing and materials options become available, these types of models will improve.

Another challenge is workflows and the accessibility of these tools. The process used here required commercial tools that are available in most 3D printing facilities but not necessarily user friendly or available to the benchtop biologist. It would be ideal if image processing programs, such as the popular image processing program ImageJ/FIJI , had better support for creating 3D model files like STL files directly. If the same programs that microscopy professionals use to process their data could also be used directly to ready their data for 3D printing, there would be more widespread use of these modeling techniques, as the cost and difficulties in workflow would be reduced.

The major uses of 3D printing of image models are for research purposes and for informal and formal science education. It is clear that a researcher would likely value having a physical representation of their dataset and that such a model might aid in discussion and informal science outreach. Such models, even if they do not lead directly to new insights, might facilitate others to become interested or be powerful demonstration aids for illustrating biological concepts. However, the path is less clear towards using such models for formal science education. A pedagogical study would need to be done to see if such printed models have utility in the classroom to teach fundamental concepts.

There have been informal classroom studies showing the utilities of using real research data in the classroom . Additionally, there have been published studies showing the advantages of 3D molecular models in the classroom . However, to our knowledge, there have been no studies showing if 3D printed models are an effective aid in formal education. For example, in a developmental biology class studying embryonic development, would 3D printed models of developing embryos directly improve comprehension of core concepts?

Despite the described challenges in technology, adoption and education use, 3D printing of biological data does have great promise. These types of models offer a tangible method to visualize complex data. These examples and the process outlined here can serve as a guide to future studies of 3D printing of biological imaging data and will hopefully help further its application.
