Thirty patients were successfully planned through an in-house CAD/CAM algorithm for reconstruction with a fibula graft. Major complications did not occur in relation to the planning itself and was attributed to pre-radiated patients. Higher risk of complications and flap loss for this patient group are described in literature . As far this workflow solution was just used for fibula graft but could also be applied to other bone grafts like scapula or iliac crest flaps . In literature assessment of surgical time regarding CAD/CAM procedures is heterogenic but mostly states time reduction . The percepted reduction of surgical time has not been tested here, but leads to a lower risk of general complications [11–13].

Work bench time was completely done by a surgeon. In our opinion the crucial virtual and laboratory work bench steps, like planning of the osteotomy lines, taking tumor resection and skin perforators in account, or the design of surgical templates need a specific background knowledge. This means these steps should be done by specific trained personnel and cannot be delegated. Thus the effect of reduction of surgery time is a result of a transition of manpower into the pre-surgical phase outside of the OR. The saved surgery time is thus only redeployed as already mentioned . Overall there is still an economization as only one person is needed for planning instead of a whole OR team.

An algorithm applicable without outsourcing makes CAD/CAM planning suitable even in urgent cases of primary cancer resections. One early shortcoming however of the current workflow is, that commercial software for surgery planning is available, but restricts rarely allows free data export thereby hindering a CAD/CAM pathway with internal resources. An open software or the development of such a solution with planning possibilities and appliances for template building does lead to further reduction of workbench time and further economization as show through the late developments in our workflow. This procedure may even allow the application in countries with lesser economic power inside the health system.

A complete in-house workflow proved more cost effective by reducing material costs, personnel costs and surgery times. A suitable outsourced 3D print costs about 700€. The self-printed 3D model costs approx. 150–220€ for each planning. In summary compared with literature estimations our in-house workflow (517–863€) seems to be lower than reported otherwise . The shortcoming of our economic evaluation is, that not all indirect costs (hard- and software) have been included and no calculation of the reduced intra-operative costs was possible. This question should be more clearly addressed in future studies including important direct and indirect costs.

A possible influence on flap survival resulting from the application of planning still needs evaluation. This far only the positive effect of pre-surgical planning on shape and esthetic outcome is described . Our hypothesis is, that the extensive involvement of the surgeons with each case necessary during the planning phase might have a positive effect on flap survival and complication rate. However the follow up time in this case series is not sufficient for a profound answer.
