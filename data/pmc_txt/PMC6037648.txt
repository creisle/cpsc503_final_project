Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) have been classified in the CAZy database into 153 GH families. Currently, there might be four α-amylase families: the main family GH13, the family GH57 with related GH119 and, eventually, also GH126. The family GH57 was established in 1996 as the second and smaller α-amylase family. In addition to α-amylase, it contains 4-α-glucanotransferase, α-glucan branching enzyme, amylopullulanase, dual-specificity amylopullulanase–cyclomaltodextrinase, non-specified amylase, maltogenic amylase and α-galactosidase. The family GH57 enzymes employ the retaining reaction mechanism, share five typical conserved sequence regions and possess catalytic (β/α)7-barrel succeeded by a four-helix bundle with the catalytic machinery consisting of catalytic nucleophile and proton donor (glutamic acid and aspartic acid at strands β4 and β7, respectively). The present bioinformatics study delivers a detailed sequence comparison of 1602 family GH57 sequences with the aim to highlight the uniqueness of each enzyme’s specificity and all eventual protein groups. This was achieved by creating the evolutionary tree focused on both the enzyme specificities and taxonomical origin. The substantial increase of numbers of sequences from recent comparisons done more than 5 years ago has allowed to refine the details of the sequence logos for the individual enzyme specificities. The study identifies a new evolutionary distinct group of α-galactosidase-related enzymes with until-now-undefined enzyme specificity but positioned on the evolutionary tree on a branch adjacent to α-galactosidases. The specificity of α-galactosidase is, moreover, the only one of the entire family GH57 for which there is no structural support for the proposal of the proton donor based on sequence analysis. The analysis also suggests a few so-called “like” protein groups related to some family GH57 enzyme specificities but lacking one or both catalytic residues.

Introduction

α-Amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) is a glycoside hydrolase (GH) catalyzing in an endo-fashion the hydrolysis of α-1,4-glucosidic linkages in starch and related polysaccharides and α-glucans. Despite the fact that the catalytic action of any α-amylase should be, in principle, the same, different protein molecules may have evolved even within the same organisms to possess the same catalytic activity of the α-amylase (Janecek et al. 2014). This means that in the Carbohydrate-Active enZymes database (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/; Cantarel et al. 2009), there have been created more α-amylase GH families reflecting especially unambiguous differences in amino acid sequences. Currently, the CAZy families GH13, GH57, GH119 and eventually also GH126 are considered as α-amylase families (Janecek et al. 2014).

The main α-amylase family, the family GH13, was established in 1991 (Henrissat 1991). At that time, regardless of the newly introduced concept of sequence-based classification of glycosidases, several α-glucan-active enzymes, e.g. cyclodextrin glucanotransferase, α-glucosidase and pullulanase, grouped around the α-amylase, were recognized to share some sequence similarities, catalytic residues and overall fold of their catalytic domain (Svensson 1988; MacGregor and Svensson 1989; Jespersen et al. 1991, 1993; Takata et al. 1992). At present, the α-amylase family GH13 represents one of the largest GH families within the CAZy database counting more than 57,000 members covering more than 30 various enzyme specificities (Janecek et al. 2014; Lombard et al. 2014). The really huge number of sequences that has still been rapidly increasing led to definition of subfamilies (Oslancova and Janecek 2002), which resulted in dividing the family into official GH13 subfamilies by CAZy curators (Stam et al. 2006), the subfamily members exhibiting a higher degree of sequence similarity to each other than to members of other GH13 subfamilies. Overall, the members of the α-amylase family GH13 employ the retaining reaction mechanism and share four–seven conserved sequence regions (CSRs; Janecek 2002), catalytic machinery and the (β/α)8-barrel (i.e. TIM-barrel) fold of the catalytic domain (Kuriki and Imanaka 1999; MacGregor et al. 2001; van der Maarel et al. 2002). In a wider sense, the family GH13 constitutes the clan GH-H together with related families GH70 and GH77 (Cantarel et al. 2009; Janecek and Gabrisko 2016).

The family GH57, created in 1996 (Henrissat and Bairoch 1996) has subsequently been established as the second and smaller α-amylase family (Janecek et al. 2014). In fact, it was based on the existence of sequences of two assumed α-amylases, one from thermophilic bacterium Dictyoglomus thermophilum (Fukusumi et al. 1988) and the other one from hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (Laderman et al. 1993a), that were mutually similar, but obviously have lacked the sequence features, i.e. CSRs characteristic of the family GH13 (Janecek 1997). Although both these fundamental family GH57 members are now recognized as 4-α-glucanotransferases (Laderman et al. 1993b; Nakajima et al. 2004; Janecek et al. 2014), the family has remained to be known as the α-amylase family despite the fact that the only amylolytic enzyme characterized as the α-amylase was shown to exhibit also the pullulanase specificity (Kim et al. 2001).

The family GH57 possesses its own basic characteristics that discriminate it from the family GH13 as follows: the catalytic domain adopts the fold of the so-called incomplete TIM-barrel, i.e. a seven-stranded (β/α)7-barrel (Imamura et al. 2003; Dickmanns et al. 2006; Palomo et al. 2011; Santos et al. 2011; Park et al. 2014; Na et al. 2017); the catalytic machinery consists of two residues—a glutamic acid as a catalytic nucleophile and an aspartic acid as a proton donor located at the strands β4 and β7, respectively, of the incomplete TIM-barrel (Imamura et al. 2001; Palomo et al. 2011); and there are five CSRs representing the “sequence fingerprints” of the family GH57 members (Zona et al. 2004; Blesak and Janecek 2012). Both families GH57 and GH13, however, are similar to each other in employing the same retaining reaction mechanism (Rye and Withers 2000).

With regard to families GH119 and GH126, the former containing only one experimentally confirmed α-amylase from Bacillus circulans (Watanabe et al. 2006) was found closely related to family GH57 (Janecek and Kuchtova 2012), whereas the latter with the only characterized amylolytic enzyme from Clostridium perfringens (Ficko-Blean et al. 2011) exhibiting, depending on the substrate, both endo- and exo-type of activity cannot be considered a pure α-amylase family since it exhibits also structural homology to β-glucan active endoglucanases from inverting families GH8 and GH48 (Janecek et al. 2014).

The main goal of the present study was to perform a detailed and overall bioinformatics analysis of the entire α-amylase family GH57. The study was undertaken in an effort to compare and divide the family GH57 members to as many as possible groups/subfamilies that could reflect the individual GH57 enzyme specificities and/or protein groups. The objective was to refine the “sequence fingerprints” covering the five previously described CSRs of the individual established enzyme specificities and, eventually, to identify novel, until now unrecognized GH57 groups, and thus to contribute further to the evolutionary picture of this interesting enzyme family.
