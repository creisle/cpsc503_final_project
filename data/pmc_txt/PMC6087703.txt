
Abstract

Rhodothermaceae bacterium RA is a halo-thermophile isolated from a saline hot spring. Previously, the genome of this bacterium was sequenced using a HiSeq 2500 platform culminating in 91 contigs. In this report, we report on the resequencing of its complete genome using a PacBio RSII platform. The genome has a GC content of 68.3%, is 4,653,222 bp in size, and encodes 3711 genes. We are interested in understanding the carbohydrate metabolic pathway, in particular the lignocellulosic biomass degradation pathway. Strain RA harbors 57 glycosyl hydrolase (GH) genes that are affiliated with 30 families. The bacterium consists of cellulose-acting (GH 3, 5, 9, and 44) and hemicellulose-acting enzymes (GH 3, 10, and 43). A crude cell-free extract of the bacterium exhibited endoglucanase, xylanase, β-glucosidase, and β-xylosidase activities. The complete genome information coupled with biochemical assays confirms that strain RA is able to degrade cellulose and xylan. Therefore, strain RA is another excellent member of family Rhodothermaceae as a repository of novel and thermostable cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes.

Introduction

Lignocellulosic biomass is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The degradation of these complex structures involves a series of enzymes that work synergistically. Enzymes responsible for cellulose degradation are cellulase, including endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4), β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), and exoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.91). These enzymes are classified into glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families GH1, GH3, GH5, GH6, GH7, GH8, GH9, GH12, GH45, and GH48 (Bohra et al. 2018). Hemicellulose is enzymatically hydrolyzed by a mixture of enzymes, including xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8), β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23), β-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25), β-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31), β-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37), β-d-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.38), and α-l-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55). These hemicellulases are mainly found in the GH families GH2, GH10, GH11, GH16, GH26, GH30, GH31, GH36, GH43, GH51, GH74, and GH95 (Bohra et al. 2018). Enzymes such as laccase, lignin peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase are also crucial in lignocellulosic biomass degradation, in particular, the lignin moiety. The majority of these enzymes can be found in the Auxiliary Activities (AA) families listed in the CAZy database (Lombard et al. 2013).

Family Rhodothermaceae has not been studied extensively for lignocellulose degradation. Members of this family are rod- or cocci-shaped, stain gram negative, non-sporulating, chemoorganotrophic aerobes, and are known to produce pigments (Park et al. 2014). Currently members of family Rhodothermaceae consists of six genera: Rhodothermus (Alfredsson et al. 1988; Marteinsson et al. 2010), Salinibacter (Antón et al. 2002; Makhdoumi-Kakhki et al. 2012), Salisaeta (Vaisman and Oren 2009), Longimonas (Xia et al. 2015), Longibacter (Xia et al. 2016), and Natronotalea (Sorokin et al. 2017). Members of the genera Rubricoccus and Rubrivirga were previously affiliated to family Rhodothermaceae (Park et al. 2011, 2013; Goh et al. 2016), but have recently been reassigned and classified as members of a new family, family Rubricoccaceae (Munoz et al. 2016). Genome sequences are available from representatives of hall genera of family Rhodothermaceae except for any representative of genus Natronotalea. To date, complete genome sequences of two representatives of this family, namely, Rhodothermus marinus and Salinibacter ruber, are available. Strain RA is a halo-thermophile (optimum growth at 2% w/v NaCl, 50 °C) which was isolated from a saline hot spring located on Langkawi Island, Malaysia (6°25′22″N, 99°48′49″E) (Goh et al. 2016; Chan et al. 2017). Due to the low DNA–DNA similarity as measured by Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC), 16S rRNA gene similarity, and the housekeeping genes to the other members of the family Rhodothermaceae, strain RA has been assigned as an unclassified taxon of the family Rhodothermaecae, order Bacteroidetes Order II. Incertae sedis, and phylum Bacteroidetes. Detailed the low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of strain RA (89%) compared to Rhodothermus spp., Salisaeta longa, Longibacter salinarum, Longimonas halophila, Salinibacter spp., and Natronotalea spp. suggests that it should be included as a new species in a newly created genus status. The genome of strain RA was initially sequenced in 2015 using a HiSeq 2500 platform and assembled into 91 contigs (Goh et al. 2016). Here, we report on the full genome using a PacBio single-molecule sequencing platform and in the presence of lignocellulose biomass-degrading enzymes.
