
Abstract

Our study aimed to elucidate the plant growth-promoting characteristics and the structure and composition of Sphingomonas sp. LK11 genome using the single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology of Pacific Biosciences. The results revealed that LK11 produces different types of gibberellins (GAs) in pure culture and significantly improves soybean plant growth by influencing endogenous GAs compared with non-inoculated control plants. Detailed genomic analyses revealed that the Sphingomonas sp. LK11 genome consists of a circular chromosome (3.78 Mbp; 66.2% G+C content) and two circular plasmids (122,975 bps and 34,160 bps; 63 and 65% G+C content, respectively). Annotation showed that the LK11 genome consists of 3656 protein-coding genes, 59 tRNAs, and 4 complete rRNA operons. Functional analyses predicted that LK11 encodes genes for phosphate solubilization and nitrate/nitrite ammonification, which are beneficial for promoting plant growth. Genes for production of catalases, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidases that confer resistance to oxidative stress in plants were also identified in LK11. Moreover, genes for trehalose and glycine betaine biosynthesis were also found in LK11 genome. Similarly, Sphingomonas spp. analysis revealed an open pan-genome and a total of 8507 genes were identified in the Sphingomonas spp. pan-genome and about 1356 orthologous genes were found to comprise the core genome. However, the number of genomes analyzed was not enough to describe complete gene sets. Our findings indicated that the genetic makeup of Sphingomonas sp. LK11 can be utilized as an eco-friendly bioresource for cleaning contaminated sites and promoting growth of plants confronted with environmental perturbations.

Introduction

Endophytic microorganisms, specifically bacteria or fungi, are known to inhabit plant tissues without causing disease symptoms in the host plant (Hallmann et al. 1997; Reissinger et al. 2001; Wilson 1995). Endophytic microbial communities have vital roles in the development and growth of various host plants under favorable and various stress conditions, such as heat, salinity, heavy metal contamination, and drought (Yaish et al. 2015). Among endophytes, bacteria have a knack for inhabiting internal plant tissues and imparting beneficial effects for host growth. Such traits have been shown to improve growth and developmental processes (Glick 1995; Ryan et al. 2008) of the host through the ability of endophytes to perform a range of functions, including assisting both primary and secondary nutrient uptake via atmospheric nitrogen fixation (Gothwal et al. 2008), synthesizing iron siderophores (Wang et al. 1993), and solubilizing minerals such as phosphate, potassium, and zinc (Basak and Biswas 2009; Iqbal et al. 2010; Kang et al. 2009). Facilitation of plant growth promotion by endophytic bacteria occurs through several mechanisms; these include mineralization of inorganic substances from the soil into host roots and production of enzymes, phytohormones, and defense-related constituents within the host environment (Khan et al. 2016a; Santoyo et al. 2016). In addition, these endophytic microbes can support the plant by providing nitrogen sources (by fixing atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia) and other nutrients, such as sulfur, iron, and phosphate. Furthermore, these microbes can protect their host plants from pathogenic attacks by regulating host plant physiology and phytohormones (Bach et al. 2016).

The endophytic bacterium Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was first isolated from the leaves of the arid medicinal plant Tephrosia apollinea and was subsequently found to actively increase growth and stress tolerance in tomato plants during salinity and cadmium stress (Halo et al. 2015; Khan et al. 2014). It has also been suggested that LK11 can produce phytohormones such as gibberellins (GAs) and auxins (Khan et al. 2014). Members of the genus Sphingomonas are yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped, nonsporulating, Gram-negative, chemoheterotrophic, and aerobic bacteria that belong to class Alphaproteobacteria within the phylum Proteobacteria (Busse et al. 2003). Sphingomonas species have been isolated from several different environments; novel strains have recently been isolated from abandoned heavy metal sites (Feng et al. 2014), forest soil (Kim et al. 2014), indoor air of pharmaceutical environments (Park et al. 2015), purplish paddy soil (Huang et al. 2014), glaciers (Miteva et al. 2004), volcano-associated lakes (Farias et al. 2011), space shuttles (Pan et al. 2016b), permafrost (Piao et al. 2016), and the sediment of a eutrophic reservoir (Huy et al. 2014). However, there are few reports describing Sphingomonas species as endophytes.

Sphingomonas species have been mostly described regarding their roles in remediating or degrading various kinds of organic and inorganic pollutants from different contamination sources. Similarly, the LK11 strain can reduce Cd2+ uptake, accumulate intracellular Zn2+, and increase metallothionein expression (which excludes heavy metals and prevents their binding by related proteins) in their host plants (Khan et al. 2014). This endophyte has the potential to thrive in high salinity (contaminated with sodium chloride) without utilizing its cellular mechanisms for producing antioxidants and related enzymes, such as peroxidases (PODs), polyphenol oxidases (PPOs), and catalases (CATs) (Halo et al. 2015). Furthermore, LK11 was recently reported to improve plant growth in both wild type and Got-3 mutant tomato plants when exogenously introduced to the plants via jasmonic acid (JA) treatment (Khan et al. 2017). The combined effects of LK11 and JA treatment caused plants to respond positively to salinity stressors by dramatically regulating glutathione content in Got-3 mutant and wild type tomato plants (Khan et al. 2017). Recent studies have also demonstrated the role of Sphingomonas spp. in the degradation of organic chemical compounds, such as bisphenol (Fujiwara et al. 2016), phenol (Gong et al. 2016), triclocarban (Mulla et al. 2016), phenanthrene (Liu et al. 2016), chlorogenic acid (Ma et al. 2016), nonylphenol polyethoxylates (Bai et al. 2016), astaxanthin (Ma et al. 2016), dioxin (Miller et al. 2010), Î³-hexachlorocyclohexane (Tabata et al. 2013), nicotine (Zhu et al. 2016), plasticizers (Kera et al. 2016), and hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (Kumari et al. 2002) among others. In addition to these degradation abilities, the Sphingomonas genus can also produce bioactive metabolites, such as indole acetic acid, gibberellins, sphingan (Li et al. 2016), and gellan gum (Gai et al. 2011b).

Previous studies have suggested the potential of LK11 as a plant growth-promoting bacterium; however, this strain has not been fully investigated for these characteristics. Therefore, the current study aimed to elucidate the whole LK11 genome and its plant growth-promoting activity. Sequencing the complete genome of LK11 will aid in resolving the complex biological mechanisms of this microorganism that promote plant growth and induce hardiness against salinity and heavy metal stress. These genomic analyses will provide a foundation towards fully understanding the characteristics of this microorganism and its potential for broader application against environmental stressors. Furthermore, comparisons with other completely sequenced Sphingomonas genomes will help delineating the unique and shared traits among different Sphingomonas species, offering insights into the evolutionary changes that have occurred within this genus.
