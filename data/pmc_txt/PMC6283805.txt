
Abstract

Objectives

The purpose was to create a time sequential three-dimensional virtual reality model, also referred to as a four-dimensional model, to explore its possible benefit and clinical applications. We hypothesized that this novel solution allows for the visuospatial benefits of the 3D model and the dynamic benefits of other existing imaging modalities.

Background

We have seen how 3D models hold great value in medical decision making by eliminating the variable visuospatial skills of practitioners. They have proved especially invaluable concerning the correction of congenital heart defects and have altered the course of many surgeries. There are, however, limitations to three-dimensional models. The static models only show what the heart looks like in one snapshot of its cycle and do not allow for an understanding of the physiological and dynamic processes.

Methods

This solution segments a 3D heart derived from a 2D image stack, times the 18 phases of a cardiac cycle and creates a 4D model that can be manipulated in space and time through the use of virtual reality.

Results

We believe the 4D heart provides a unique understanding of in situ cardiac anatomy not possible with other imaging techniques. Our expanding case series of clinician experiences and their immediate recognition of the potency of this technique is highly encouraging and reveals the future of functional and dynamic 4D representations of anatomy.

Conclusions

The 4D heart improved our understanding around complex 3D relationships over time. We propose time and effort dedicated to 4D cardiac imaging analysis of dynamic cardiac pathologies such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or a pre-op Rastelli repair with a narrow outflow tract could offer tremendous insight into the medical decision-making process.

Introduction

It has long been the standard to view medical pathologies on a two-dimensional plane, but the advent of creative technology allows for medical imaging to extend beyond the second dimension. Here we present what we call the four-dimensional heart - also referred to as a time sequential three-dimensional virtual reality model. We have seen in our lab how 3D models hold great value in medical decision making by eliminating the variable visual spatial skills of practitioners. They have proved especially invaluable in cases concerning the correction of congenital heart defects and have altered the course of many surgeries . There are, however, limitations to three-dimensional models. The static models can only show what the heart looks like in one snapshot of its cycle and do not allow for an understanding of the physiological and dynamic processes. Additionally, the cost of the printer and material necessary to make the models may impede adoption of this practice . There are other forms of imaging that add in a third or fourth dimension. The standard three-dimensional echocardiogram allows for a greater understanding than computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multi-dimensional technologies such as the 4D flow MRI and the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computer model allow for in depth analyses of the physiology, but all are limited by their two-dimensional interactions on a screen . The novel solution we devised was the 4D, time sequential 3D model that allows for the visuospatial benefits of the dynamic 3D model. As more CFD and 4D flow solutions enter the clinical field, this visualization technique will find more utility. This solution segments a 3D heart derived from a 2D image stack, times the 18 phases of a cardiac cycle and creates a 4D model that can be manipulated in space and time through the use of virtual reality. Our lab has worked with virtual reality technology in multiple areas of medicine including the cost-effective transition from printing physical 3D hearts to importing the 3D structure into a virtual reality platform with the same effect. We have also seen how a virtual reality platform originally developed within the University of Illinois as a communication device for surgical planning around virtual 3D models of congenital heart disease is now being used for medical education . The efficiency and endless potential of this technology inspired us to create the 4D heart. We believe the 4D heart provides a unique understanding of in situ cardiac anatomy that is not possible with other imaging modalities.
