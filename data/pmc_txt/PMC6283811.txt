In the present study, we describe fused deposition layering 3D printing as a process for impregnating contrast materials into 3D printed objects, with the proof-of-concept focusing on surgical mesh. Excellent visibility was demonstrated for CT imaging using all three contrast agents; however, contrast stability over time was demonstrated only with the barium infused mesh. The fused deposition layering 3D printing process described in the present study can potentially be applied for developing medical implants, with contrast in all layers – or all but the most external layers, for additional contrast-material containment. Moreover, contrast-impregnated fused deposition layering 3D printing can be used to create anatomic models to be CT scanned for pre-procedural planning, for image-guided therapies, or as phantoms.

In the simulated tissue environment (agar solution at 37 °C), only barium retained its visibility with a consistent mean HU compared to the pre-agar solution. The attenuation of both iodine and gadolinium both significantly decreased and were poorly visually perceptible in the agar solution, with apparent increase in contrast-material within the agar suggesting leaching of the material into the agar at body temperature.

Surgical meshes have variable appearances on imaging. On CT and MR imaging, different commercial meshes are either not visible, indirectly or poorly visible, or highly-visible. For CT, meshes with intrinsic high attenuation will have better visibility on CT . There have been a number of “MR visible” meshes that design the mesh to accentuate signal voids. These meshes do not produce signal, but rather accentuate their signal voids by incorporating materials such as iron particles to achieve visibility by sharp signal dropout compared to surrounding tissue .

In this study, we describe a novel method of incorporating contrast materials into 3D printed constructs using a fused-deposition modeling 3D printer. The incorporation of the contrast into the 3D printed construct itself increases the volume of contrast that can be incorporated compared to superficially coating with contrast and “protects” the contrast material deep in the construct from dilution that may occur with handling or cleaning/sterilization procedures. Although this technique may or may not have future use in printing custom meshes, there are a number of immediate ways this contrast-incorporating technique can be potentially used. Broadly, potential applications where impregnated contrast materials may be helpful include 3D printed phantoms, anatomic models, procedural/surgical instruments, and implants other than surgical mesh. 3D printed constructs have been used for a number of CT phantom studies [24–27]. The contrast-incorporating technique described in the present study may be used to increase x-ray attenuation of anatomic structures, such as high proportions of contrast being used to delineate high-density structures such as the axial and appendicular skeleton or at a diluted concentration to distinguish intermediate-density structures such as visceral organs from surrounding fat. Another potential application is printing anatomic models for simulation and training of fluoroscopic or CT-guided procedures. Few studies have reported 3D printed constructs being used to facilitate CT or fluoroscopic procedures .

There are a number of limitations to this study. A single base material, PCL, was tested using a single commercial fused deposition modeling 3D printer. PCL was chosen given its ease to work with, availability, and that it has been previously used in studies impregnating drugs and other bioactive materials into 3D printed constructs [2–4]. The specific commercial print head used in this study directly used the contrast-PCL mixtures to print the meshes, without an intermediate filament extrusion step. Future studies to validate the method of contrast impregnated 3D printed constructs could include broadening the number of materials used, including common materials such as polylactic acid and polyvinyl alcohol, and incorporating other commercial 3D printers that require a preceding filament extrusion step. The 3D printed meshes in this study were imaged outside of tissues and in isolation; the appearance of a surgically implanted mesh may vary dramatically when embedded in tissues. The nature of this project was to demonstrate utility of this synthetic approach in creating materials with ideal imaging properties. Highly visible commercial meshes used in clinical practice are chosen for the factors of the mesh with relevance to ease of insertion and proven efficacy. At the time of this writing, 3D printed meshes have not been reported in humans; however, a number of in vitro studies have demonstrated the feasibility of surgical meshes impregnated with drugs or hormones . To fully validate the use of these mesh types in patients will require pre-clinical animal studies that compare the surgical efficacy toxicity, imaging characteristics, and longevity of imaging characteristics.
