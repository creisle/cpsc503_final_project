
Abstract

Trehalose is the main blood sugar in insects. To study the function of trehalase during exposure to low temperatures, three other novel cDNAs of trehalase were cloned from Harmonia axyridis by transcriptome sequencing and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. One of the cloned cDNAs encoded a soluble trehalase, the second trehalase cDNA encoded a transmembrane-like domain, and the third cDNA encoded a membrane-bound protein. Therefore, these cDNAs were, respectively, named HaTreh1-5, HaTreh2-like, and HaTreh2. HaTreh1-5, HaTreh2-like, and HaTreh2 cDNAs encoded proteins containing 586, 553, and 633 amino acids with predicted masses of approximately 69.47, 63.46, and 73.66 kDa, and pIs of 9.20, 5.52, and 6.31, respectively. All three novel trehalases contained signal motifs “PGGINKESYYLDSY”, “QWDYPNAWPP”, and a highly conserved glycine-rich (GGGGEY) region. The expression levels of HaTreh1-5 and HaTreh2 mRNAs were high during adult stages, whereas HaTreh2-like was expressed in low amounts in the fourth larval stage. The results showed that the activity of membrane-bound trehalases decreased from 25 to 10 °C and from 5 to − 5 °C during cooling. The results also revealed a decreasing trend in expression of the three HaTreh mRNAs during the cooling treatment, and an initial decrease followed by an increase during the process of re-warming.

Introduction

The disaccharide trehalose consists of two glucose units linked through an α-glycosidic bond, which can synthesize in insect fat body by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose phosphate phosphatase (TPP) pathway (Caner et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2010; van Wyk et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2017; Tang et al. 2018). To our knowledge, trehalose is the main sugar in the hemolymph of insects, and exists in all kinds of organisms, except mammals. Its function is very important in insects and fungi (Elbein et al. 2003; Frison et al. 2007; Silva et al. 2010; Wingler 2002; Xu et al. 2009; Tang et al. 2018). Trehalose can be stored as energy and carbohydrates, and it is an agent that protects proteins and cell membranes from various environmental stress conditions, including desiccation, heat, freezing, and oxidation (Caner et al. 2013; Crowe et al. 1984; Eleutherio et al. 1993; Koštál et al. 2014). However, the detailed mechanisms of how trehalose protects insects from cold are still poorly understood, and little information about its effects under rapid cold or re-warming is present. To utilize blood trehalose, insect tissues have trehalases (alpha-glucoside-1-glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.28) that catalyze the hydrolysis of one mole of trehalose to two moles of glucose (Silva et al. 2004; Thompson 2003; Shukla et al. 2019; Adhav et al. 2019). Trehalases are thought to be located on the cell membrane or within the cell cytoplasm (Valaitis and Bowers 1993; Yaginuma et al. 1996; Nardelli et al. 2019).

The first study on soluble trehalase in insects involved the purification and assessment of some properties of this enzyme, including genetic and biochemical aspects, in Drosophila melanogaster. Only one molecular form of trehalase (E.C. 3.2.1.28) was detectable in adult D. melanogaster by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing (Bargiello and Grossfield 1980; Huber and Lefebvre 1971; Oliver et al. 1978). The first insect trehalase cDNA, a soluble trehalase, was cloned and reported in 1992 from Tenebrio molitor (Takiguchi et al. 1992). Although insects were divided into two types of trehalases, soluble (named Treh1, Tre1 or TreS) and membrane-bound (named Treh2, Tre2 or TreM) depending on whether they have potential putative transmembrane helices or domains, while Treh2 gene was not reported until 2005 (Mitsumasu et al. 2005). Treh2 possesses a transmembrane domain and is usually larger, whereas Treh1 lacks a transmembrane domain (Shukla et al. 2015). Treh1 is a cytosolic enzyme that hydrolyses endogenous trehalose, whereas Treh2 is an extracellular enzyme (Ma et al. 2015). Treh2 is believed to face the blood side, degrading the extracellular trehalose (Mitsumasu et al. 2005). The glucose so generated then enters into the cell and is utilized for physiological activities (Shukla et al. 2015). Moreover, most of the insect species, such as Spodoptera exigua (Chen et al. 2010; Tang et al. 2008), Apis mellifera (Lee et al. 2007; Mori et al. 2009), Bombyx mori (Kamei et al. 2011; Mitsumasu et al. 2005), Laodelphax striatellus (Zhang et al. 2012), Omphisa fuscidentalis (Tatun et al. 2008a, b), D. melanogaster (Shukla et al. 2016), Chironomus ramosus (Shukla et al. 2019), and others (Bansal et al. 2013), have genes for one soluble and one membrane-bound trehalase or only one of the trehalases. Two Treh1 and one Treh2 genes have been cloned from Nilaparvata lugens (Gu et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2016), four Treh1 have been cloned from Harmonia axyridis (Shi et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2014), four Treh1 and one Treh2 have been cloned from Tribolium castaneum (Tang et al. 2016). However, not only two Treh1 and one Treh2, but also one Treh2-like have been cloned from Locusta migratoria (Liu et al. 2016), it is the first-reported insect to have a Treh2-like protein.

These trehalase genes have been cloned and studied in almost all the pests because of which they could be employed as potential target genes for insect control (Liebl et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2016). Treh1 and Treh2 are known to regulate wing development, flight metabolism, and chitin biosynthesis, and they also play distinct roles in chitin biosynthesis and other physiological activities (Chen et al. 2010; Shukla et al. 2015). The beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), is an important natural enemy of pests, such as aphids, whiteflies, psyllids, mites, and the eggs and larvae of some lepidopterans and coleopterans (Luciana et al. 2015; Zappalà et al. 2013); it is the focus of pest control strategies in agriculture and forestry in Asia, including China (Tang et al. 2014), but is notorious for its invasiveness of the ecological niche of other ladybird beetles in Europe (Adriaens et al. 2008; Brown et al. 2008a, b). Cold hardiness and diapause are essential components of winter survival for most insects in temperate zones, but in many cases the relationship between these two are not clear (Heydari and Izadi 2014). The cold-hardiness of H. axyridis represents an important characteristic and has been widely studied with respect to biological control applications and aspects of invasiveness (Bazzocchi et al. 2004; Berkvens et al. 2010; Pervez and Omkar 2006; van Lenteren et al. 2008). In addition, the genes controlling trehalase were identified as important to low-temperature stress resistance (Shi et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2016). Four soluble trehalase genes (HaTreh1-1 to HaTreh1-4) have been cloned (Shi et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2014). In the present study, a new soluble trehalase (HaTreh1-5), one membrane-bound (HaTreh2), and more importantly, one like membrane-bound trehalase (HaTreh2-like) cDNAs from H. axyridis were identified and cloned. The results obtained in this study can help understand the response of the trehalase gene to cold stress: withstanding loss of activity at low temperature, protecting cell function and thus surviving a sustained low-temperature exposure, or repairing damage upon re-warming from a chill exposure.



Discussion

Insect trehalase proteins have the same or similar characteristic motifs (“PGGRFREFYYWDSY”, “QWDYPNAWPP” and “GGGGEY”), which are essential for catalytic activity and substrate-binding functions (Mitsumasu et al. 2005; Shukla et al. 2015; Tang et al. 2008, 2012; Nardelli et al. 2019). All these features suggest that it is a relatively conserved protein family (Forcella et al. 2010). HaTreh1-3 showed low identity with HaTreh1-5 (35.12%), HaTreh2-like (31.57%), and HaTreh2 (32.77%) (Table 2), which could also be the reason for HaTreh1-3 being present on a separate branch in the Treh1 phylogenetic tree compared to the other Treh1s and for HaTreh1-3 showing only 28–40% identity to other known Treh1 family genes (Tang et al. 2014). HaTreh1-1, HaTreh1-3, and HaTreh1-4 were present on a single branch in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). They also possessed some other conserved motifs, including “PVD/ELN” and “PRPESY” (Fig. 1), similar to the other HaTreh1s (Tang et al. 2014). Moreover, most of the insects only have one Treh1 and one Treh2 proteins, with only the coleopteran insects T. castaneum and H. axyridis having more than three soluble trehalase genes (Shi et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2014, 2016). In L. migratoria, it also has four trehalase genes, and a Treh2-like gene has been found, which is expressed in all tissues, such as integument, midgut, Malpighian tubules, fat body and so on. In addition, the expression levels of Treh1 and Treh2 in tissues are specific (Liu et al. 2016). In the same time, a Treh2-like gene was also found in H. axyridis in our study, and this is the first-found Treh2-like gene in insect. We believe that trehalases are very important proteins and the Treh genes evolved through time; Treh2-like might represent the gene for a protein, intermediate in form, between the soluble and membrane-bound trehalases. Therefore, Treh2-like could be a new class of trehalase genes, then more and more similar Treh2-like genes will be found.

The pI of soluble trehalases in insects is known to be around 4.5 and that of the membrane-bound forms is around 6.5 (Tang et al. 2012). However, pIs more than 6.5 have also been reported for some insect trehalases. It was reported that the pI of HaTreh1-3 was 8.88 and was similar to that of TcTreh1-2 (8.81), TcTreh1-3 (7.02), and DpTreh1-3 (6.56) (Shi et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2014). The pI of HaTreh1-5 has also been reported to be 9.20 and hence is positively charged, favoring adsorption onto the negatively charged matrix, also being higher than that of HaTreh1-4 (6.32), HaTreh2-like (5.52), and HaTreh2 (6.31). Almost all the insect trehalases have one signal peptide or putative cleavage sites, ranging from 1 to 30 aa in length (Tang et al. 2012), an exception being AmTreh2 (NM_001112671) with a 35 aa signal peptide (Mori et al. 2009), while two Treh1 and one Treh2 in L. migratoria did not have the signal peptide structure (Liu et al. 2016). The signal peptide in the coleopterans contains about 20 aa, HaTreh1-1 to HaTreh1-4 have a 20- or 21-aa-long signal peptide, and HaTreh1-5 and HaTreh2 have signal peptides with 24 and 20 aa, respectively (Fig. S1A, C). It is interesting to note that HaTreh2-like did not have a signal peptide (Fig. S1B), this result is similar to L. migratoria Treh1 and Treh2 genes (Liu et al. 2016).

Many soluble insect trehalases were observed to be expressed in the midgut, fat body, epidermis, ovary, and Malpighian tubules of larvae in T. molitor (Gomez et al. 2013; Takiguchi et al. 1992), B. mori (Kamei et al. 2011; Kamimura et al. 1999), Pimpla hypochondriaca (Parkinson et al. 2003), as well as four soluble and one membrane-bound trehalases expressed in cuticle, fat body, midgut and Malpighian tubules of the last larvae in T. castaneum (Tang et al. 2016). The expression of Treh1 and Treh2 in S. exigua was mainly observed in the last instar larvae, pupae, and adults (Chen et al. 2010). Most of the insects need two kinds of trehalases to use trehalose during the different developmental stages, but they only have one soluble and membrane-bound trehalase gene. However, H. axyridis has more than seven trehalase genes. Therefore, various trehalase genes play their specific functions at different stages of life. It can be found from the expression of five HaTreh1, one HaTreh2-like and one HaTreh2 during the development stages (Shi et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2014). HaTreh1-1 and HaTreh1-2 might play the role in the larval stage whereas HaTreh1-3 might have a role in stages from larva to adult (Tang et al. 2014). Moreover, HaTreh1-3, HaTreh1-5, and HaTreh2 are known to have roles in the adult stage (Fig. 3) (Shi et al. 2016). HaTreh2-like may also have a role during the pre-pupal stages (Fig. 3). In short, HaTreh1-5, HaTreh2-like, and HaTreh2 have unique expression patterns through the developmental stages. These genes, including the other four HaTreh1 genes, co-regulate the changes in the trehalose content and energy production to adapt to the development processes in H. axyridis.

Previous studies on the protective function of trehalose under different stress conditions, including desiccation, dehydration, heating, freezing, and oxidation, have been reported (Bale and Hayward 2010; Crowe et al. 1984; Elbein et al. 2003; Khani et al. 2007; Shimada 1984). In insects, trehalose participates in both the homeostasis and development as does the blood sugar (Silva et al. 2004; Thompson 2003); it is involved in processes such as flight metabolism, cold tolerance, and so on (Tatun et al. 2008a, b). In H. axyridis, the trehalose contents significantly increased when adults were placed at 5, 0, and − 5 °C during the cooling process (Shi et al. 2016), suggesting that it can protect H. axyridis from the cold stress, it was induced and as a cryoprotectant at 5 °C condition. A previous study showed that soluble trehalase activity could be gradually suppressed with the decrease in temperature (Shi et al. 2016). In the present study, we detected the membrane-bound trehalase activity (Treh2) during the cooling and warming processes. We observed that 5 °C was the turning point of the change of Treh2 activity, and the enzyme activity was the strongest at 5 °C (Fig. 4). Shi et al. found that trehalose content was the highest level at 5 °C during cooling process, it showed some sugars, such as glycogen, has transformed into trehalose (Shi et al. 2016). These results also indicate that a temperature of 5 °C may be critical for the adaptation of insects to cold; at this temperature, the insect not only requires more energy from trehalose, it also needs more trehalose for the cold-resistance property of this sugar. For this reason, trehalases play an important role in insects transforming energy stored in different sugars. These results suggest that Treh2 activity plays a key role in the adaptation to the cooling process.

Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene expression has also been reported to increase from 25 to 5 °C during the cooling process (Qin et al. 2012). During the process of warming, the Treh1 activity showed an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and was increased again at 25 °C (Shi et al. 2016). Treh2 activity was increased and was maintained at high levels throughout (Fig. 4b) in conjunction with a decrease in the trehalose content, signifying that Treh2 might be playing a role in the warming process. However, the expression level of TPS, trehalose content and Treh activities increased when trehalase inhibitor of validamycin injected into N. lugens (Tang et al. 2017).

Trehalose is an energy source for insects providing energy for the movement and development of insects. It is rapidly used when the insect faces stress conditions (Tang et al. 2014; Thompson 2003). In contrast to cold acclimation during overwintering, which is induced over several weeks or months, rapid cold hardening of arthropods can be induced by a short exposure (several minutes or hours) to low temperatures (from 0 to 5 °C) or through gradual cooling (from 0.1 to 1 °C min−1) over a range of temperature (Lee et al. 1987; Lee 1991). The changes in the trehalase activity can be achieved through the modulation of the expressions of trehalase genes. For example, our results indicate that the relative expressions of Treh2-like and Treh 2 genes were consistent with changes in Treh2 activity during cooling (first decline, then increase at 5 °C, then decrease). However, during the warming process, the trends between them were different, and we speculated that it may be related to other physiological processes not found in H. axyridis. In the present study, we observed changes in the expression of HaTreh1-5 and HaTreh2 mRNAs in the adults of H. axyridis subjected to rise and drop in temperature over a short period of time (Fig. 5). The expression of HaTreh1-4 has also been reported to decrease under cooling process (Shi et al. 2016) and the Treh1 activity was also observed to decrease. These results suggest that HaTreh1-4 and HaTreh1-5 play the main role during this process. HaTreh2-like and HaTreh2 could be sharing a similar function during the cooling process as revealed by their expression pattern and the Treh2 activity (Figs. 4a, 5c, e). The expression of all the three HaTreh mRNAs showed a decreasing trend during the cooling process, indicating that all the Trehs play a protective role during low temperatures although the expression of those Treh genes are suppressed (Fig. 5). The expression of TPS mRNA has previously been shown to increase initially and then decease following the drop in temperature in H. axyridis adults (Qin et al. 2012). Moreover, higher TPS expression can increase the content of trehalose only if the activities of trehalase remain unchanged or decreased because of the decrease in Treh mRNA levels. It is also reported that the trehalose content increased when single TPS gene was knocked down (Tang et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2017). H. axyridis is an important predatory ladybug and a natural enemy of agricultural and forestry pests. It is very necessary to apply it to biological control, but low-temperature storage is a difficult problem. The results of Figs. 4 and 5 provide a theoretical basis for screening storage temperatures and the ability to improve resistance to low temperatures through cold training, such as 5 °C as a potential storage temperature. In addition, it seems that the rapid low-temperature stress of H. axyridis is more conducive to the accumulation of trehalose than the gradual cooling, because Treh2 activity has been maintained at a high level.

Trehalase is well known to be important in insect growth, development, and molting processes, and is involved in providing energy (Tang et al. 2008; Matsuda et al. 2015; Shukla et al. 2015; Yoshida et al. 2016). Moreover, the roles of different Treh1 genes are not same, although the function of trehalases is to degrade trehalose to glucose (Tang et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2014; Shukla et al. 2015). The reason for the presence of more than five soluble trehalases, and a Treh2-like trehalase in some insects and understanding of their specific functions in development and growth, especially for tissue-specific distribution and its function on disaccharide–monosaccharide transition during different tissues at different time and conditions, would need further investigation.
