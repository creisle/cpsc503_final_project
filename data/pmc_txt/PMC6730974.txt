
Abstract

J-proteins which function as molecular chaperone played critical roles in plant growth, development, and response to various environment stresses, but little was reported on this gene family in rice. Here, we identified 115 putative rice J-proteins and classified them into nine major clades (I–IX) according to their phylogenetic relationships. Gene-structure analysis revealed that each member of the same clade has same or similar exon–intron structure, and most rice J-protein genes of clade VII were intronless. Chromosomes mapping suggested that tandem duplication was occurred in evolution. Expression profile showed that the 61 rice J-protein genes were expressed in at least one tissue. The result implied that they could be involved in the process of rice growth and development. The RNA-sequencing data identified 96 differentially expressed genes, 59.38% (57/96), 67.71% (65/96), and 62.50% (60/96) genes were induced by heat stress, drought stress, and salt stress, respectively. The results indicated that J-protein genes could participated in rice response to different stresses. The findings in this study would provide a foundation for further analyzing the function of J-proteins in rice.

Introduction

Plants, as sessile organisms, have to deal with complex environmental cues including a variety of stresses, such as high salt, extreme temperature, water deficiency, oxidative stress, chemical pollutants, and pathogens (Al-Whaibi 2011). Unlike animals, plants cannot change their sites to escape from the unfavorable conditions, and therefore, they have evolved with a spectrum of molecular mechanism that regulates their cellular proteome with the changing external environment (Kosová et al. 2011; Kurepa et al. 2009). When the expression of the genes is coding for heat shock proteins (Hsps) which are trigged by heat, as well as in other stresses, Hsps accumulate in the organism (Gupta et al. 2010; Lindquist and Craig 1988), and increased expression of these genes can enhance the heat tolerance of plants (Wang et al. 2018). Hsps have been classified into six groups, such as Hsp100, Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp60, Hsp40/J-protein, and small Hsp (sHsp/Hsp20) based on their molecular weight (Georgopoulos and Welch 1993; Lindquist and Craig 1988). The Hsp40 family of molecular chaperones includes DnaJ, and this family is also designated the J-protein family. J-proteins have been often regarded as obligate partners of Hsp70s as neither Hsp70s, nor the J-proteins can work without each other (Tamadaddi and Sahi 2016). In the integrated model of protein surveillance system, J-proteins are the co-chaperones of Hsp70, and the molecular mechanism of the latter collaborates with Hsp100; thus, the activity of Hsp70 is regulated by J-proteins (Miot et al. 2011; Sielaff and Tsai 2010). In all the organisms studied so far, the number of Hsp40s is always more than the number of Hsp70s. For example, there are 22 Hsp40s and 14 Hsp70s in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seven Hsp40s and three Hsp70s in Escherichia coli, 45 Hsp40s and 17 Hsp70s in human, 36 Hsp40s and 11 Hsp70s in Drosophila melanogaster, 118 Hsp40s and 18 Hsp70s in Arabidopsis thaliana (Craig and Marszalek 2017; Walsh et al. 2004). Therefore, a single Hsp70 may bind a diversity of J-proteins to perform protein folding, prevention of protein aggregation, translocation of proteins across membranes, targeting proteins towards degradation, and regulation of translation initiation.

J-proteins were originally characterized from E. coli as a 41-kDa Hsps (Georgopoulos et al. 1980). The J-domain, the defining feature of all J-proteins, is a compact tetrahelical domain of ~ 70 residues with a highly conserved and functionally critical histidine, proline, and aspartic acid tripeptide (HPD) motif (Verma et al. 2017). J-proteins are classified into three types based on the presence of specific conserved regions. Type A J-proteins are characterized by an N-terminal J-domain followed by a glycine/phenylalanine (G/F)-rich region, four repeats of the CxxCxGxG-type zinc-finger domain, and a C-terminal domain. Type B J-proteins are very similar to Type A J-proteins, except that they lack the CxxCxGxG-type zinc-finger domain. Type C J-proteins are the most diverse group, as they only carry the J-domain. The proteins that contain a J-like domain but lack the critical HPD tripeptide are classified as type D J-proteins (Kampinga and Craig 2010). Rice J-proteins have been classified into three classes (corresponding to types A–C) according to domain organization (Sarka et al. 2013). However, some recently reported rice J-proteins still lack identification and their phylogenetic relationships are unknown; in addition, the expressions of the gene coding for J-proteins under multiple stresses are unclear.

In plants, J-proteins have been localized to different subcellular compartments. In rice, for example, 63, 15, and 8 J-proteins have been localized to the cytoplasm, chloroplast, and mitochondrion, respectively (Walsh et al. 2004). In A. thaliana, six J-proteins were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 19 to the chloroplast (Chiu et al. 2013; Ohta et al. 2013; Yamamoto et al. 2011). Furthermore, J-proteins not only function as co-chaperones in various biological processes (Miernyk 2001), but also act as enzymes or epigenetic regulators (De et al. 1995; Richly et al. 2010). In A. thaliana, the farnesylated J2 and J3 associate with AGO1 in membrane fractions in a manner that involves protein farnesylation, and also influences the distribution of miRNA between polysome-bound and unbound fraction (Sjögren et al. 2018); the J-proteins embryo sac development arrest 3 (EDA3) and thermosensitive male sterile 1 (TMS1) are implicated in the thermotolerance of pollen tubes (Valencia-Morales et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2009); the flowering time is regulated by AtJ3 via its direct binding to a MADS-box transcription factor (Shen et al. 2011), and AtJ8, AtJ11, and AtJ20 are involved in the optimization of photosynthetic reactions and stabilization of photosystem II (PSII) complexes under high light stress (Chen et al. 2010). In tomato, LeCDJ1 is also found to be essential for maintaining PSII under chilling stress in tomato (Kong et al. 2014b), and its J-domain is the key farnesylation target in meristem size control, abscisic acid signaling, and drought resistance (Barghetti et al. 2017). Lee et al. cloned the alfalfa DnaJ-like protein (MsDJLP) gene downstream of the strong constitutive CaMV 35S promoter and transformed it into tobacco plants, the result showed that overexpression of the MsDJLP gene enhances tolerance to chilling and heat stresses in transgenic tobacco plants.

Here, we identified 115 J-protein coding genes in the rice genome, and systematically analyzed the corresponding J-proteins. The classification, chromosomal localization, gene structure, domain organization, and expression profiling of J-protein genes in different tissues and under different abiotic stress conditions were performed.
