
Abstract

Background

Medical 3D printing has brought the manufacturing world closer to the patient’s bedside than ever before. This requires hospitals and their personnel to update their quality assurance program to more appropriately accommodate the 3D printing fabrication process and the challenges that come along with it.

Results

In this paper, we explored different methods for verifying the accuracy of a 3D printed anatomical model. Methods included physical measurements, digital photographic measurements, surface scanning, photogrammetry, and computed tomography (CT) scans. The details of each verification method, as well as their benefits and challenges, are discussed.

Conclusion

There are multiple methods for model verification, each with benefits and drawbacks. The choice of which method to adopt into a quality assurance program is multifactorial and will depend on the type of 3D printed models being created, the training of personnel, and what resources are available within a 3D printed laboratory.



Introduction

3-dimensional (3D) printing is a method of fabrication that allows for the creation of graspable 3D objects from a digital blueprint. One of the most compelling use cases for 3D printing in medicine is the creation of patient-specific anatomical models for presurgical planning [1–3]. In these cases, the digital blueprint used for printing is created from a patient’s medical imaging data . The resultant physical model can be given to a surgeon/ interventionalist, offering him or her an opportunity to plan the surgery before stepping into the operating room/catheterization lab. Due to positive feedback from the use of these 3D printed anatomical models during pre-surgical consultations, there has been a push to explore additional ways that 3D models can be used. Other examples of using 3D printed models in the hospital include benchtop surgical simulation [5–7], sizing of devices prior to a surgery or procedure [8–13], and designing patient-matched surgical cutting guides or implants [16–21].

Established quality assurance (QA) programs exist for many areas of medicine, including medical imaging. In radiology, these include Quality Control (QC) programs for ensuring optimal performance of imaging acquisition hardware and QA programs for dose reduction, appropriate use, radiologist interpretations, and reporting of results . A handful of hospitals have led the way in adapting and extending imaging QA programs for use in 3D printing [25–27], including the creation of new phantoms that test the performance and accuracy of 3D printers and materials . As 3D printing programs push past enhanced visualization as a product deliverable and begin to create true medical devices, there is a need to expand the existing QA programs within hospitals to create a more robust QA program inclusive of 3D printing as a clinical resource.

Verification refers to ensuring that a part is physically made to product specifications within a given tolerance (e.g., a model of a patient’s heart matches the dimensions of the patient’s actual heart within ±1 mm), while validation ensures that the model will fulfill its intended purpose and meet the customer’s needs and expectations (e.g., the model of a patient’s heart will allow the surgeon the opportunity to practice the procedure prior to surgery). Verification that a part is built to pre-defined specifications may seem straightforward on the surface, but it can pose multiple challenges in the 3D printing space. Measuring organic shapes can be complicated; several measurement techniques have been employed to date with variable results, including manual measurements with calipers [28–30], photogrammetry, optical [31–33] and contact-based surface scanning , and x-ray/ CT scanning of a part. Another challenge is that verification requires knowing the 3D printed part’s desired dimensions, which in the case of patient-specific anatomical models means knowing the accurate dimensions of the patient’s anatomy. These reference dimensions are often impossible to physically measure if the anatomy is internal, and therefore the reference standard for a given 3D model or part is often based on medical imaging, which becomes a stand-in for ground truth.

In this paper, we explore several measurement methods for verifying the accuracy of 3D-printed cardiac models and discuss some of the unique challenges we encountered with each method. This work is not meant to determine the superiority of one technique over the other nor to make a statement about what technique should ultimately be used. Instead, it is meant as an overview and a conversation starter concerning the challenges inherent in part verification.



Discussion

A quality assurance (QA) program takes years to establish and build and is comprised of numerous components, each with its inherent intricacies. Here, we explored one component of a QA program - verification of part accuracy. Verification requires measurement of final model dimensions and comparison of those measurements to the physical geometry of the patient’s anatomy. In cases of internal anatomy, the patient’s medical imaging often serves as a proxy for the actual anatomy. The substitution of imaging data for ground truth inherently introduces some degree of error into the verification process, which is mitigated by established radiology department QC/QA practices for ensuring image accuracy. It is important to remember that the quality of the imaging always constrains the quality of the model.

Unfortunately, each step in the process of 3D-printing an anatomical model can introduce error (Fig. 8). Because of this, it is necessary to minimize and continue to monitor errors created by the fabrication process to ensure safe and impactful use of these models in a clinical setting. Checkpoints in the design process are often used for intermediate verification checks. For example, overlaying a final STL on the original DICOM image or comparing a point cloud obtained from surface scanning of the final model to the STL file are examples of these types of checks. The challenge is that none of these methods fully verify the model, since they depend on derivatives of the patient’s anatomy and are, in of themselves, subject to the introduction of errors.Fig. 8Infographic overview of 3D printed model / part verification

There are multiple strategies for part measurement, including manual measurements, digital photographic measurements, surface imaging strategies (3D surface scanning and photogrammetry) and CT scanning. We sampled various options as part of feasibility testing in building our quality assurance program. It is important to emphasize that the data presented here is not a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of these measurements in of themselves (which has been done elsewhere). Instead, the goal was to discover the strengths and weaknesses of each technology in our hands to find the best fit for clinical heart model verification in our hospital-based program (Table 3).Table 3Different measurement techniques have advantages and disadvantagesTechniqueOverviewAdvantagesDisadvantageManual measurementsMeasuring instruments such as digital calipers are used to physically measure features.• Cost effective• Straightforward technique• Can be difficult to access internal structures• Overtightening of calipers can deform flexible models• Non-linear measurements such as perimeters cannot be accomplished with calipersDigital photographic measurementsThe process requires photographing a feature of interest with a reference scale in the same plane.

Physical measurements presented early challenges, as critical non-linear cardiac anatomy such as the aortic and mitral valve annulus could not be measured with calipers or a ruler. We used a malleable wire to mark perimeter lengths but found the inter-observer variability to be more than twice that of measurements made with calipers. A portion of that variability is likely technical, as small bends in the wire that were not perfectly smoothed out introduced error. More importantly, however, it required personnel with extensive anatomical training to make the measurements, and concepts such as how to measure the mitral valve annulus were dependent on the background and training of the person performing the measurements. Digital photographic measurements could potentially mitigate the challenges of nonlinear measurements but were still limited to being utilized for external structures, and the requirements for marker placement and camera set-up were non-trivial.

We investigated two methods for measuring the surface of models- structured light surface scanning and photogrammetry. We learned that model material color heavily influenced the success of these methods in our hands; we were unable to obtain usable datasets for clear and white resin models. Marking the models with talcum powder or a developer spray may have helped with scanning, but we were concerned that those options would have affected the overall part geometry, and for that reason, they were not used in this study. While there were multiple additional steps we could have taken to improve results with these techniques, including testing different types of scanners (for surface scanning) or improving image acquisition techniques (for photogrammetry), we determined that the time and staff training needed was outside of the scope of what was feasible for our program. These techniques are likely to perform well in hospital-based programs that have optimized the process and have staff who are experienced with these techniques.

We found that CT scanning circumvented many of the challenges faced by other measurement techniques. Perhaps most importantly, CT scanning of the 3D printed model allowed end-to-end verification of the entire 3D printing workflow by comparing the final 3D printed model directly to the patient’s anatomy in the original DICOM images (Fig. 8). Overlaid 3D printed model and patient DICOM images were easily scrolled through by a radiologist, allowing for overall qualitative confirmation of accuracy and additional quantitative measurements of critical parts of the model at the discretion of the radiologist (e.g., aortic annulus measurements in a model intended for pre-procedural planning for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, Fig. 7). An additional benefit was that our radiology staff have baseline expertise in CT technology, and therefore required no additional training to incorporate model verification into their daily workflow.

One potential challenge of using CT to verify 3D models is the requirement for DICOM image registration. Fiducial markers or distinct landmarks are often necessary for image registration, but these require foresight to add to the patient before a scan. To minimize the challenges of landmark registration, we used the CT table itself as a fiducial marker. This strategy allowed for rigid image registration with a minimum of time and effort (less than 5 min, on average), but at the cost of the design and printing time that came with the creation of the heart holder. A portion of the design work may be automated going forward.

Limitations

This work is limited by the small sample size and lack of statistical analysis. We did not test contact-dependent methods of surface analysis, such as a coordinate measurement machine. We did not troubleshoot initial challenges with surface scanning and photogrammetry approaches, and we do not present the steps required for registration of surface point cloud data with STL files needed for model verification with these strategies. The model-specific heart holder presented here for CT scanning is a prototype, and has not been tested with flexible models or anatomy outside of cardiac models.. Finally, while the methods described are detailed with respect to cardiac models, it is very likely that modifications to ensure accuracy would be necessary for other clinically appropriate 3D printed models.
