The increasing availability and versatility of 3D printing has vastly changed the landscape of medical technology development. Coupled with the opportunities created to develop affordable and customized parts using 3D printing, there is a trend in medicine to provide personalized treatment for improved care and outcome measures. Individualized, customizable devices like the CSBT described here for cancer patients, offers an opportunity to improve radiation dose distribution to a target volume while reducing the amount of normal tissue that is irradiated. The CBST we designed permits the superposition of small treatment fields at the skin surface so that patient- and tumor-specific dosing plans can be altered to best suit the neoplastic lesion needing treatment.

Importantly, the device described here may significantly lower the overall cost of treatment compared to conventional electron therapy. By improving dose distribution and tumor control, there is also the possibilty of reducing patient visits over time by preserving cosmesis and reducing risk of tumor recurrence. While it does require the purchase of a reliable printer, the design of a device such as this may be widely implemented across radiation institutions once it is validated for clinical use. The long-term goal of work such as this is to improve the ability to target irregular skin lesions, particularly those over sites like the nose or ears, by taking advantage of 3D printing technology. A successful, clinical device will expand affordable care options to many skin cancer patients, and improve patient comfort and compliance.
