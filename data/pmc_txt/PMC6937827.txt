
Abstract

Advanced visualization of medical image data in the form of three-dimensional (3D) printing continues to expand in clinical settings and many hospitals have started to adapt 3D technologies to aid in patient care. It is imperative that radiologists and other medical professionals understand the multi-step process of converting medical imaging data to digital files. To educate health care professionals about the steps required to prepare DICOM data for 3D printing anatomical models, hands-on courses have been delivered at the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) annual meeting since 2014. In this paper, a supplement to the RSNA 2018 hands-on 3D printing course, we review methods to create cranio-maxillofacial (CMF), orthopedic, and renal cancer models which can be 3D printed or visualized in augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR).
