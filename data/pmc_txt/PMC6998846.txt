
Abstract

Background

The structure of the valve leaflets and sinuses are crucial in supporting the proper function of the semilunar valve and ensuring leaflet durability. Therefore, an enhanced understanding of the structural characteristics of the semilunar valves is fundamental to the evaluation and staging of semilunar valve pathology, as well as the development of prosthetic or bioprosthetic valves. This paper illustrates the process of combining computer-aided design (CAD), 3D printing and flow assessment with 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide detailed assessment of the structural and hemodynamic characteristics of the normal semilunar valve.

Methods

Previously published geometric data on the aortic valve was used to model the ‘normal’ tricuspid aortic valve with a CAD software package and 3D printed. An MRI compatible flow pump with the capacity to mimic physiological flows was connected to the phantom. A peak flow rate of 100 mL/s and heart rate of 60 beats per minute were used. MRI measurements included cine imaging, 2D and 4D phase-contrast imaging to assess valve motion, flow velocity and complex flow patterns.

Results

Cine MRI data showed normal valve function and competency throughout the cardiac cycle in the 3D-printed phantom. Quantitative analysis of 4D Flow data showed net flow through 2D planes proximal and distal to the valve were very consistent (26.03 mL/s and 26.09 mL/s, respectively). Measurements of net flow value agreed closely with the flow waveform provided to the pump (27.74 mL/s), confirming 4D flow acquisition in relation to the pump output. Peak flow values proximal and distal to the valve were 78.4 mL/s and 63.3 mL/s, respectively.

Particle traces of flow from 4D-phase contrast MRI data demonstrated flow through the valve into the ascending aorta and vortices within the aortic sinuses, which are expected during ventricular diastole.

Conclusion

In this proof of concept study, we have demonstrated the ability to generate physiological 3D-printed aortic valve phantoms and evaluate their function with cine- and 4D Flow MRI. This technology can work synergistically with promising tissue engineering research to develop optimal aortic valve replacements, which closely reproduces the complex function of the normal aortic valve.





Discussion

The semilunar valves are uniquely structured to open and close without the aid of the chords and papillary muscles. The tricuspid semilunar valve with properly sized and shaped sinuses of Valsalva appears to be the ideal configuration for optimal hemodynamics, compared to mono or bicuspid variants [4, 8–10]. Any alteration in the number of valve leaflets, the size of the valve annulus and the size and shape of the sinuses may result in inadequate flow or turbulence across the valvular orifice and damage to the valve leaflets. Both aortic and pulmonary valve diseases are not uncommon and require replacement of the diseased valve with a prosthetic or bioprosthetic valve through surgery or intervention [11–13]..

3D printing of patient specific aortic root phantoms has previously been used successfully to develop procedural simulations for in vitro transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR) and to quantitatively assess post-TAVR aortic root strain and potential incidence of paravalvular leak using computed tomography . Our pilot study provides the first demonstration of 3D printing of flexible semilunar valves fabricated with CAD, followed by detailed assessments of function and flow using cine- and 4D Flow MRI.

The results generated further validate the efficacy of using additive manufacturing as a feasible and effective methodology to assess semilunar valve function. In addition, it has been shown that 4D flow MRI can be used in phantoms to investigate the complex flow patterns within the aortic root, which are crucial in evaluating valve leaflet closure and coronary artery perfusion. This method can support ongoing work in the field of computational -fluid dynamics (CFD), which has analyzed normal aortic valve function, in addition to simulating surgical repairs of the aortic root [15–18].

The workflow demonstrated in this paper can be applied to the investigation of: 1) the structural requirements for optimal function and durability of the semilunar valve and the sinuses of Valsalva, 2) the study of the hemodynamic changes in association with abnormal valve leaflet and sinus configuration such as various forms of bicuspid and quadricuspid valves, and 3) the effect of the dilated aortic root on aortic valve anatomy and function in systemic connective tissue diseases such as Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes. Although the listed features can be assessed in living individuals, in-vivo studies are associated with numerous confounding factors such as ventricular function, heart rate, distal vascular resistance and anatomical variations. Inevitably this method requires a large study population to prove the given hypotheses. As any number of combinations of anatomical and hemodynamic variations can be fabricated with CAD and 3D printing, with the other confounding factors kept constant, the structural and functional importance of each component of the valve and sinus can be isolated and assessed in detail. Fabrication of individualized semilunar valve phantoms with computer and phantom flow dynamic studies may ultimately allow optimized design of bioprinted implantable valves. The experimental setting with phantoms can also be used for validation of the flow assessment tools including Doppler ultrasound, 2D- and 4D-flow MRI using precisely calibrated flow pumps. This methodology streamlines the process from prototyping to valve testing, reducing the time required to optimize the structure of the semilunar valve.

Potential areas for improvement of the demonstrated workflow include: quality of 3D print material, the CAD technique for valve design and the physiological fidelity of the flow pump and circuit. The current commercially available 3D print material used to generate the valve phantoms does not have identical elastic, strength or biochemical properties to human valve tissue and will remain a limitation of this method until improved materials are available. While we were able to fabricate the valve leaflets with 0.6 mm thickness with the current commercially available print material, the forthcoming materials allow for fabrication of valve leaflets with a much more realistic 0.3 mm thickness . The use of a compliance chamber within the circuit, instead of an open circuit, would also improve the ability to control diastolic pressures being a more accurate reflection of physiological conditions. Although MRI has been proven to be a useful and accurate tool for flow assessment, further validation of 2D- and 4D flow -MRI is required in a larger number of phantom studies. Echocardiography can also be used as an additional modality to confirm the finding found on MR. This would be particularly useful in in-vivo studies where MR availability may be limited.

Future directions

Further experimentation with anatomically accurate phantoms will potentially advance our understanding of physiological valve function. With valve repairs being more desirable than replacements, particularly in the pediatric population; this methodology could potentially be used to assess the efficacy and durability of current novel aortic valve repair techniques prior to performing these complex procedures. Additionally, it may provide a safe platform to develop and validate future surgical valve repair techniques. Prior to patient translation, tissue engineering with in-vivo animal studies is the next step to validate this methodology. Tissue-engineered valves will address issues of biocompatibility and valve leaflet durability with the 3D-printed phantoms providing accurate geometric data for valve scaffolds with favourable flow dynamics.
