Total tumor size (TS) metrics used in TS models in oncology do not consider tumor heterogeneity, which could help to better predict drug efficacy. We analyzed individual target lesions (iTLs) of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) to determine differences in TS dynamics by using the ClassIfication Clustering of Individual Lesions (CICIL) methodology. Results from subgroup analyses comparing genetic mutations and TS metrics were assessed and applied to survival analyses. Data from four mCRC clinical studies were analyzed (1781 patients, 6369 iTLs). CICIL was used to assess differences in lesion TS dynamics within a tissue (intra-class) or across different tissues (inter-class). First, lesions were automatically classified based on their location. Cross-correlation coefficients (CCs) determined if each pair of lesions followed similar or opposite dynamics. Finally, CCs were grouped by using the K-means clustering method. Heterogeneity in tumor dynamics was lower in the intra-class analysis than in the inter-class analysis for patients receiving cetuximab. More tumor heterogeneity was found in KRAS mutated patients compared to KRAS wild-type (KRASwt) patients and when using sum of longest diameters versus sum of products of diameters. Tumor heterogeneity quantified as the median patient’s CC was found to be a predictor of overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.08–1.92), especially in KRASwt patients. Intra- and inter-tumor tissue heterogeneities were assessed with CICIL. Derived metrics of heterogeneity were found to be a predictor of OS time. Considering differences between lesions’ TS dynamics could improve oncology models in favor of a better prediction of OS.

INTRODUCTION

Model-Informed Drug Discovery and Development (MID3) has demonstrated its usefulness to improve drug development in several cases, including the oncology area and the modeling of tumor size (TS). TS is often expressed as the sum of longest diameters (SLD) of the individual tumor lesions (iTLs) measurable and defined as “target lesions” at baseline, as described by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Each patient presents multiple iTLs, which can be primary or metastatic and located in several organs or tissues. This means that all tumor lesions, regardless of their location and status, are reduced to this single SLD value, also called the total TS, at each assessment visit within a patient. The iTLs are assessed throughout the clinical study; the SLD is derived at each time point and then categorized to quantify the tumor response to the treatment. Observed or model-derived TS metrics, such as the early tumor shrinkage (ETS, relative reduction of total TS at certain time points) or time to tumor growth, have been shown to be predictors of overall survival (OS).

As an oversimplifying measure of cancer progression, the use of total TS may cause a loss of information with respect to tumor heterogeneity that could carry valuable information to predict disease progression, drug efficacy, and OS accurately. Indeed, differences in iTLs dynamics could reflect tumor heterogeneity: tumor lesions may present several clones which evolve in a Darwinian process at different rates, showing different phenotypes and drug resistances. Tumor heterogeneity is one of the factors involved in tumor resistance and tumor metastasis. Recently, some modeling works in the oncology area successfully included tumor heterogeneity and related this lesions’ variability to OS. Not including tumor heterogeneity into TS models may hide iTLs resistance development or other differences in response to treatment. This is not only due to the different clonal phenotypes but also due to the different tumor microenvironments in which the lesion has appeared.

In a previous work, the analysis of iTLs was performed to assess differences in lesions dynamics by using the Classification Clustering of Individual Lesions (CICIL) methodology, which integrates knowledge from signal processing and machine learning (ML). Results were used to then inform decisions about building a longitudinal model for iTLs or for total TS. The work presented in this paper continues and expands the innovative approach started by Terranova et al. by applying CICIL to four clinical studies in which cetuximab was administered in different combination therapies. TS data from these studies were analyzed either to assess the iTL dynamics between different organs or anatomic regions or to determine tumor dynamics differences within an organ or tissue. Furthermore, several comparisons between groups of patients based on differences in gene mutations and tumor metrics were performed. The impact of tumor heterogeneity on the clinical outcome was also assessed.

The objectives of this work were as follows: (i) to determine tumor heterogeneity in lesion dynamics using iTLs, (ii) to compare iTLs dynamics from patients based on genetic mutations (KRAS) and different TS metrics, and (iii) to apply these results in survival analyses of considered clinical trials.

This approach was applied to four metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) clinical studies. CRC is any kind of cancer which affects the colon or rectum. More than 1.8 million new cases and 881,000 deaths related to CRC were estimated to occur in 2018. If only mCRC is considered, the main therapy for many years was 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with folinic acid (FA). This therapy regimen showed a poor response rate (20%) and a median OS of about 6 months. Newer chemotherapy drugs, like irinotecan and oxaliplatin, improved the response rate to 31–34% and the median OS to approximately 24 months. Monoclonal antibodies have provided new weapons to fight mCRC. One of them is cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The EGFR is involved in survival, proliferation, tumor invasion, and tumor immune evasion. It has been observed that patients with RAS mutations, including mutations of the KRAS and NRAS genes, present poorer response to EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab, which is the drug studied in this work. According to intention-to-treat (ITT) populations in considered clinical trials, only information about KRAS status was available and was accounted in our assessments.

DISCUSSION

Despite enriching data analysis in oncology, lesion heterogeneity has been often ignored or disregarded in the TS modeling, as also highlighted by the limited number of published works in this field. This is due to the complex models and methods needed to consider differences between organs or tissues, as well as the intra-tumor heterogeneity within an anatomic area. Models with such features are complex and computationally expensive. Thus, being able to efficiently assess and quantify the heterogeneity in iTLs TS dynamics prior to any modeling analysis is extremely valuable to inform and to guide the best modeling strategies. The recently proposed CICIL methodology addressed this objective by exploiting ML techniques to inform subsequent modeling steps. This approach provides a user-friendly and automated framework to quantify heterogeneity in tumor dynamics at different levels: (i) between iTLs within an organ and (ii) between lesions located in different tissues. Results can be used to make data-driven modeling decisions, for example, about the use of total TS versus iTLs TS, and about the level (within or across tissues) of tumor heterogeneity to be accounted for in the model.

In this work, we used CICIL to analyze TS data of patients’ iTLs from four mCRC studies investigating cetuximab treatment. The classification of iTLs considered the three main lesion classes “Liver”, “Lung”, “Lymph node”, and the general class “Other”. The low number of iTLs for the least frequent classes (i.e., “Other respiratory organs”, “Other digestive organs”, “Other specified organs”, “Primary lesions” and “Unclassified lesions”) did not allow us to assess intra-tumor heterogeneity in those classes separately and they had to be pooled into a single class called “Other”. Results indicated that the majority of iTLs were located in the liver (68%). Liver was also the most representative class in a previous analysis of two other cetuximab mCRC clinical studies. This is in line with available literature highlighting the liver as the most common site of metastasis in mCRC patients due to its anatomical position with respect to the portal circulation.

CICIL results from the intra-class analysis indicated little intra-tumor heterogeneity in TS dynamics of patients’ iTLs from the same classified tissue (less than 23% of iTL pairs at zero-time shift across the three main classes). Such results were obtained with a rich dataset including 863 patients and 2990 iTLs across studies which supports the robustness of the conclusions. Thus, we considered it conceivable to neglect intra-tumor heterogeneity in subsequent subgroup analyses performed in this work.

In the inter-class analysis, tumor heterogeneity between lesions located in different tissues (cTLs) was found to be higher. In particular, in the analysis based on the cetuximab arm, 36% of CCs or cTLs pairs (from 38% of patients) were found to follow different TS dynamics at zero-time shifts. This percentage is also marginally larger than the one (35% lesion pairs from 30 to 35% patients) obtained in a previous work, and it is mainly driven by the CRYSTAL study (44% lesion pairs from 45% patients) as the largest study in this work. When time shifts were considered, such percentage of CCs dropped to 13%. This points to the possibility that time delays could account for some of the observed tumor heterogeneity in the patient, e.g., a delayed response to the drug in some tumor tissues. It should be noted that in both analyses some patients presented iTLs with only two TS assessments, which made their CCs not as informative as those coming from lesions with more than two TS measurements.

Cetuximab patients with cTLs expressing KRASwt genetics showed less tumor heterogeneity in TS dynamics than KRASmut patients. Cetuximab, as an EGFR inhibitor monoclonal antibody, presents lower efficacy if lesions present with KRAS mutations. Therefore, we may relate this increased tumor heterogeneity in KRASmut patients to their reduced response to Cetuximab.

For those studies that measured the longest diameter and the perpendicular one, inter-class results obtained with the longest diameter were compared to those using the product of diameters as TS metric. The combined analysis from the pooled dataset did not suggest any differences between results obtained with SOPD and SLD metrics. Nevertheless, results for the CRYSTAL study showed smaller differences in cTL dynamics and then in tumor heterogeneity when SOPD was used as the TS metric (38% with SOPD vs 45% with SLD). This may point to a better characterization of tumor heterogeneity when bidimensional data are collected for this case study. Indeed, literature shows that such differences between TS metrics depend on the kind of cancer: in some cases, there are no differences between unidimensional or bidimensional measurements, while in other cases, there are significant differences between results obtained with these two metrics.

Tumor heterogeneity results obtained in the inter-class analysis were found to be a predictor variable of OS time in the form of median CC. Its significance was proven both alone (log-rank test and the Kaplan-Meier plot) and in combination with other known risk predictors (multivariate Cox proportional hazards model). Increased risk of death with increased heterogeneity was suggested by all tested models. Interestingly, the model including a significant interaction term between the heterogeneity metric and the KRAS status suggested a relevant decrease of risk (about 40%) with decreased heterogeneity in KRASwt patients, but a small decrease (about 3%) in KRASmut patients. This points to a reduced impact of heterogeneity in TS dynamics on risk for KRASmut patients which is however already associated with a lower treatment effect in this subpopulation. Pharmacokinetic-tumor size-overall survival relationships can be affected by immortal time and selection bias, in particular, in situations without dose-ranging data. As the estimation of our tumor heterogeneity measure is related to the number of tumor assessments the patient had over the study and this depends on the immortal time, the potential for immortal bias cannot be excluded. More sophisticated models including time-dependent covariates allowing a change in status over time may be tested in future works to overcome the potential for immortal time bias.

As one of the major outcomes of this work, such results further highlight the impact of tumor heterogeneity on tumor response and the importance of including it into survival analyses. Besides, modeling in the oncology arena could benefit from including measures of tumor heterogeneity data such as CC values. For example, the use of “tissue-agnostic” datasets in which individual lesions are considered and grouped based on the degree of similarity in their TS dynamics could improve the performance of TS models in favor of a better prediction of OS time.
