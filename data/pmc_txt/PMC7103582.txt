A detailed understanding of the fate of xenobiotics introduced into the environment and the mechanisms involved in their biotransformation, biodegradation, and biosorption is essential to improve the efficiency of remediation techniques. Mycoremediation is a form of bioremediation technique that has become increasingly popular in recent years as fungi are known to produce various effective extracellular enzymes that have the potential to neutralize a wide variety of xenobiotics released into the environment. Hence, mycoremediation appears to be a promising technique for the removal of a wide array of toxins and pharmaceutical residues from a damaged environment and wastewater. This study primarily aimed to investigate whether white-rot fungus (Lentinula edodes) can be utilized for the bioremediation of common antifungal agent terbinafine, which is mainly available in the market as powder or cream. The cultures of L. edodes were cultivated in the medium containing terbinafine powder or terbinafine 1% cream, each at a final concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1. The addition of terbinafine in powder form have a negative effect on biomass growth (p < 0.05). The total amount of terbinafine in the dry weight of mycelium after culture was estimated to be 7.63 ± 0.45 mg and 12.52 ± 2.46 mg for powder and cream samples, respectively. In addition, there were no traces of terbinafine in any of the samples of medium used for culturing L. edodes after the experimental duration period. The biodegradation products of terbinafine were identified for the first time using UPLC/MS/MS. The biodegradation of terbinafine resulted in the loss of 1-naphthylmethanol, which occurred via oxidative deamination, N-demethylation, or tert-butyl group hydroxylation. The results of the study demonstrate that L. edodes mycelium can be effectively used for the remediation of terbinafine.



Introduction

Environmental pollution with drugs, pesticides, and personal care products is one of the most challenging issues that the world is facing today. Pharmaceutical compounds play an indispensable role in the treatment and prevention of diseases. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can enter the environment as a result of various manufacturing processes involved in the production of medicinal products, following medical diagnosis and therapeutic use of pharmaceuticals for the prevention of diseases, or due to disposal of unused medications. According to Executive Agency for Health and Consumers, the annual worldwide consumption of pharmaceutical compounds is estimated to be about 100,000 tonnes (Mudgal et al. 2013). APIs and their metabolites are identified in sewage, surface water, soils, sludge, and air. Their widespread occurrence and potential adverse effects on ecosystems and human health, mainly associated with long-term exposure to low concentrations of pharmaceuticals, are a subject of public concern (Sousa et al. 2012; Patel et al. 2019). After being released into the environment, active metabolites might further undergo degradation to produce toxic end products, which involves complex processes that significantly depend on various factors (Boxall, 2004). The investigation concerning the potential risk of drugs present in the environment to the aquatic ecosystems is particularly important (Hilton et al. 2003). Therefore, a better understanding of the fate of medicines in the environment is crucial in attempting to achieve effective drug removal from the surroundings. In response to the growing demand for environmental remediation techniques, numerous studies on water and soil remediation processes, including in situ and ex situ methods, have been carried out. Ex situ methods involve isolation, transportation, and disposal of pollutants at a distant and safe place, but this procedure has been proven to be very expensive. In general, technologies based on physicochemical characteristics of pollutants, such as photocatalytic advanced oxidation processes, membrane-based techniques (membrane filtration and reverse osmosis) and chemical and physical adsorption mechanisms, are considered to be highly efficient and cost-effective methods (Kryczyk et al. 2016; Bartolomeu et al. 2018; Warsinger et al. 2018). The recent studies and development in this field are mainly based on the use of nanotechnology, as this novel approach is known to yield better results than the conventional methods. Another possible approach is based on the use of eco-friendly biological processes such as in situ biodegradation. Biological decomposition (bioremediation) is an effective strategy for the removal or transformation of xenobiotics into less toxic forms. Studies conducted worldwide have reported that antifungal drugs (pharmaceutical fungicides) pose a potential threat to the ecosystem. These drugs, particularly those registered for both human and veterinary use, are commonly used as oral or topical agents. This class of drugs could be found in cosmetic products and can be obtained as over-the-counter drugs. In addition, antifungal agents are also widely used in agriculture. Reports of the latest studies establish antifungal drugs as the emerging environmental contaminants (Chen and Ying 2015). The persistence of antifungal drugs in soil and water is highly variable, and it has been observed that some azole antifungals have increased stability and could remain active in some ecological conditions for months (Hof 2001). In Sweden, these agents have been detected in sludge, and the concentrations of clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and econazole are reported to be in the range of 200–1000 µg kg−1 dry weight (Lindberg et al. 2010). The occurrence of antifungal agents in the environment has been confirmed in studies conducted locally in many countries (Lindberg et al. 2010; Chen and Ying, 2015; Balakrishna et al. 2017). Terbinafine, an antifungal agent, was detected in the water samples collected from the wells of India at a concentration of more than 1 μg L−1 (Fick et al. 2009). Furthermore, this compound was also isolated there from lakes and rivers (Fick et al. 2009). In our previous work, we focused on the mycoremediation of antifungal drugs from the azole group: clotrimazole and bifonazole (Kryczyk-Poprawa et al. 2019). This study primarily aimed to investigate whether white-rot fungus can be effectively utilized for the bioremediation of common antifungal agent terbinafine (in powder and cream forms). Terbinafine hydrochloride, a synthetic allylamine derivative, is widely used for the treatment for fungal infections owing to the fact that it exhibits broad-spectrum antifungal activity and its price is relatively low when compared to other antifungals. Hence, this drug was selected for investigation purpose in the present study. Terbinafine acts by reversible inhibition of squalene epoxidase, an enzyme responsible for ergosterol biosynthesis. This biochemical mechanism is responsible for the fungistatic and fungicidal activity of the drug on fungal mycelia. According to the current medical guidelines, terbinafine is recommended as the first-line treatment for dermatophyte onychomycosis, mainly due to its high efficacy and tolerability properties (Ameen et al. 2014). In 2001, about 1.5 million prescriptions for drugs containing terbinafine were issued in the US alone (Davis et al. 2019). Mushroom cultures could also be utilized to remove xenobiotics from the environment (Kryczyk et al. 2017; Dąbrowska et al. 2018). Lentinula edodes was selected for the current study because of its unique nutritional and healing properties. The Japanese common name of L. edodes is “shitake.” The fruiting bodies of L. edodes contain a number of compounds that contribute to its pharmacological effects, mainly immunomodulatory and anticancer properties. The fruiting bodies of this species are rich in bioactive polysaccharides such as β-d-glucans (lentinan), monosaccharides, vitamins, and eritadenine (2(R),3(R)-dihydroxy-4-(9-adenyl) butyric acid). These mushrooms also produce many enzymes, such as peroxidase, cellulase, pectinase, xylanase, ligninase, and oxidase. Since L. edodes produces oxidative and hydrolytic extracellular enzymes, it can participate in xenobiotic degradation process (Leatham 1985). Additionally, this species was effectively used for the remediation of azole antifungal drugs (Kryczyk-Poprawa et al. 2019). For the above-mentioned reasons, the mycoremediation potential of L. edodes mycelia against terbinafine was investigated in in vitro cultures. The medium used for culturing L. edodes was enriched with terbinafine powder or terbinafine 1% cream with the final concentration of the investigated drug being 0.1 mg mL−1. The biodegradation products of terbinafine were analyzed by UPLC/MS/MS method.
