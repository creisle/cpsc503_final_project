
Abstract

Cancer immunotherapy has recently drawn remarkable attention as promising results in the clinic have shown its ability to improve the overall survival, and T cells are considered to be one of the primary effectors for cancer immunotherapy. Enhanced and restored T cell tumoricidal activity has shown great potential for killing cancer cells. Bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs) are a growing class of molecules that are designed to bind two different antigens on the surface of T cells and cancer cells to bring them in close proximity and selectively activate effector T cells to kill target cancer cells. New T cell engagers are being investigated for the treatment of solid tumors. The activity of newly developed T cell engagers showed a strong correlation with tumor target antigen expression. However, the correlation between tumor-associated antigen expression and overall response of cancer patients is poorly understood. In this study, we used a well-calibrated quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model extended to bispecific T cell engagers to explore their efficacy and identify potential biomarkers. In principle, patient-specific response can be predicted through this model according to each patient’s individual characteristics. This extended QSP model has been calibrated with available experimental data and provides predictions of patients’ response to TCE treatment.

Discussion

T cell engagers, as a class of bispecific antibodies, have attracted a lot of attention recently due to their unique ability to activate cytotoxic T cells in an MHC-independent manner, thereby releasing cytokines and cytotoxic granules that inhibit tumor growth. Currently, two approved bispecific antibodies (one of the two is a TCE) are in clinical practice and about 100 are in clinical development. As an engineered antibody, there are many factors to consider carefully in the design process, such as the antibody format, target antigen on the T cell, tumor target antigen, and affinity and valency for both T cell and tumor antigens. These factors will ultimately determine TCE potency. These factors may be dependent on the cancer cell type, and there is currently a lack of effective ways to study the impact of changes in these factors. The TCE module described here provides a tool to solve this issue and provides a means for guiding the design of new TCEs, improving current TCEs, and can be used as an aid for designing and analyzing clinical trials.

Our TCE module has corroborated the importance of the biTCC formation for potent anticancer activity, and high-avidity is an important prerequisite for maintaining high biTCC density especially for those cells with low tumor antigen expression. Moderate to high monovalent binding affinity was also essential, since low affinity tumor antigen binding, even in the presence of high λ, resulted in suboptimal biTCC density. In addition to handling bivalent TCEs, our module can be readily modified to study monovalent TCEs by modifying the governing equations.

Optimization of CD3 binding affinity is another viable path for improving TCE potency. To avoid tumor target-antigen–independent T cell activation, monovalent binding to CD3 is preferred. Interestingly, increasing CD3 affinity was not beneficial for stable biTTC formation in this model. This finding is consistent with Bortoletto et al. who observed reduced T cell activation with increasing CD3 binding affinity. In other studies, a positive correlation between the tumor cell killing and CD3 binding affinity was also reported by Ellwanger et al. using different anti-CD3 antibodies, target antigens, and formats. High anti-CD3 binding affinity has been associated with preferential distribution to CD3-rich lymphoid tissues and less effective tumor distribution. Optimization of CD3 affinity needs to consider many factors, and our model can provide some aspects of the impact of anti-CD3 affinity on drug efficacy.

The relationship between biTTC density and antibody concentration can also be monitored by our model under the influence of various factors. The amount of all TCE-related species can be monitored to study how they change with increasing TCE concentration. For TCEs with fixed parameters, our model can quickly find a reasonable range of antibody concentrations for optimal efficacy. When designing bispecific antibodies, our model can also be used to predict the appropriate range of binding parameters to support an optimal dose regimen, especially when considering combination therapies.

In addition to providing theoretical guidance for molecular design using the newly developed TCE module, our previously published QSP models demonstrated the ability to model tumor immunity and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The models were also used for biomarker discovery and performing virtual clinical trials by integrating anti-tumor immune response, antigen processing/presentation, and T cell priming in lymph nodes. The validated model provided a starting point for the study of TCEs. We integrated the new TCE module with the whole QSP model while keeping the main QSP model unchanged, enabling a virtual clinical trial to be performed for cibisatamab in colorectal cancer patients. All simulations started from a single cancer cell, thereby capturing individual initial conditions before cibisatamab treatment. Progression of the tumor was then simulated over the next 400 days to observe tumor size changes and identify potential biomarkers.

TMB was one of the most important predictive biomarkers affecting tumor size. It directly affects the expansion of Teff cells and higher TMB corresponds to higher T cell density and Teff/Treg ratio in tumor. As predicted by our model, low TMB corresponded to a low response rate. There was no responder found when either TMB or Teff/Treg ratio was below the median. Other potential biomarkers such as CEA expression and intrinsic cross-arm binding efficiency λ showed a positive correlation with overall response rates. Interestingly, patient cohorts with different CEA expression levels showed different sensitivity to λ. For patients with intermediate CEA expression (1E+4–3E+5 sites/cell), λ has significant impact on tumor diameter, since λ ensured the formation of stable biTTC for cells with lower CEA expression; for high CEA expression cells (3E+5–1E+6 sites/cell), the sensitivity was reduced since the effect of λ on high expression tumor cells was moderate (Fig. S4A,B). These observations are also consistent with the results in “Effect of CEA expression on the density of biTTC and moTTC” section, i.e., λ had little effect on cells with high tumor target antigen expression. Anti-CD3 affinity (koff of CD3-TCE) was negatively correlated with overall response rates. These are consistent with the predictions of the stand-alone TCE module.

CD3 expression on Teff and Treg cells was based on available experimental measurements; our model limited the CD3 expression to the data reported in the literature and within this range had little effect on TCE efficacy. Importantly, it has been reported that Treg cells can also be activated by TCEs and have the potential to inhibit the activity of Teff cells, even though the overall response rate was highly dependent on the Teff/Treg ratio. However, our model predicted that the impact of Treg on Teff cells can be ignored. The reason being that there are three main ways of T cell exhaustion including basic apoptosis of T cells, additional death caused by Treg and cancer cells. Typically, non-responders had faster tumor growth rate resulting in larger tumor with more cancer cells. These cancer cells would kill more Teff through several pathways. The death of Teff by Treg may not be able to show significant impact on the number of Teff, but the overall death rate of Teff was a very sensitive parameter, which corresponded to Teff density in tumor and Teff/Treg ratio. Other related reports also pointed out that CD8+ T cells respond much faster by cross-linking via bispecific antibodies than do CD4+ T cells and many other studies have shown successful treatment with bispecific antibodies in the presence of Tregs. It has been reported that E/T ratio changed the rate of T cell killing activity (48–50). T cell killing activity may have been saturated with high E/T ratio (10:1), which would result in underestimation of both T cell activity and TCE efficiency. Thus, we have taken the uncertainty of it into consideration by adding the T cell killing activity to the list of sensitivity analysis parameters to explore the effect of underlying underestimation of T cell killing activity. Within the range we defined for T cell activity (Table S3, Rate of cancer death by T cell), it did not show significant effect on the treatment outcomes (Fig. 7b).

By assessing the tumor response using RECIST vs. a set of parameters, we can more intuitively assess the impact of a parameter on the patients’ response. The increase in some parameters is positively correlated with treatment effect while others are negatively correlated. Interestingly, for some parameters, once they exceed a threshold value, the patients’ overall response rate will significantly increase, and further increases in these parameters has little effect on the overall response rate. An example of such behavior is the CEA expression on tumor cell, where a poor response was found for those patients with low CEA expression (< 1.0E+4 sites/cell). For patients with higher CEA expression (> 1.0E+4 sites/cell), the overall response rate was enhanced significantly, but no correlation was found between CEA expression and overall response rate above this level. Patients with CEA expression ranging from 1.0E+4 to 3.0E+5 have a similar overall response rate of ~ 12%.

Enhanced antitumor activity of cibisatamab in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab has been reported in phase 1a and 1b studies (clinical trials: NCT02324257 and NCT02650713). The current TCE-extended QSP model can be used to identify potential predictive biomarkers for such combinations by comprehensive analysis of patients’ response and the differences between the non-responders and responders. Increased emphasis on the clinical development of monoclonal and bispecific antibodies that harness a patient’s own immune system to kill cancer cells necessitates the availability of highly parameterized QSP models that can be used to optimize clinical study design and the selection of combination partners for oncology targets. Our modular model makes the process of simulating virtual clinical trials faster and easier, by enabling the incorporation of additional modules as new immune mechanisms are discovered.

Even though we have calibrated the TCE module using experimental data, there are still some factors that have not been considered completely. In the current model, one assumption is that moTTC does not contribute significantly to the activation of T cells. Because of their lower affinity and stability compared with biTTC, their effects were ignored as a first approximation; however, further validation is needed. Tregs have been reported to have potent cytotoxic effects through the granzyme-perforin pathway. The death of cancer cells by Treg needs to be added and calibrated based on available experiments. Currently the TCE module only applies to bivalent TCEs. The dynamics of monovalent TCEs needs to be modified and related parameters also need to be recalibrated. The numbers of naïve CD8+, and CD4+ T cells are constant in central and tumor-draining lymph node compartments. Dynamics of the naïve T cells is important in large tumors in which T cell activation could result in depletion of antigen-specific naïve T cells and in turn cause non-response. The assumption of constant density of naïve T cells could hold true for smaller tumors but most likely will overestimate the response in large tumors. In our next version of the model, we will modify the model by incorporating naïve T cell dynamics including the naïve T cell selection in thymus, proliferation in the peripheral tissues as well as differentiation and death. Importantly, this whole QSP model has limitations in predicting the overall response rates of patients since we cannot accurately estimate the range and distribution of patient parameters and the estimation is highly dependent on the clinical measurements. Certain parameters are difficult to measure in the clinic, and their values have to be extrapolated from animal experiments, which will affect the accuracy of the predicted overall response rate and the reliability of the relevant biomarkers. The problem of how to generate virtual patients and virtual cohorts is an area of active research in academia and pharmaceutical industry (14,51–53), and more reliable ways should emerge in the future to improve model predictions. We also envision that the predictive power of QSP modeling will increase with each application in different cancer types.
