
Abstract

Understanding the genetic determinants are essential for improving the fruit quality traits of strawberry. In this study, we focused on mapping the loci for fruit-length (FL), -diameter (FD), -weight (FW) and -soluble solid content (SSC) using the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified via ddRAD-sequencing of the F1 population raised from Maehyang (♀) X Festival (♂). A total of 12,698 high quality SNPs were identified of which 1554 SNPs that showed significant Mendelian segregation (p < 0.05) were mapped to 53 linkage groups (LG) spanning a total of 2937.93 cM with an average marker density of 2.14 cM/locus. Six QTLs for FL and four QTLs for each of FD, FW and SSC were identified that explained 24–35%, 21–42%, 24–54% and 23–50% of overall phenotypic variations, respectively. The genes that lie within these QTL regions were extracted and discussed thoroughly. In addition, a high resolution melting marker (MF154) were designed based on the SNP A1723G of the UDP-glucose 4-epimerase GEPI48-like gene FAN_iscf00021287. The marker detected the high vs low sugar containing F1 plants and commercial cultivars with 81.39% and 86.95% detection accuracy, respectively. These SNPs, linkage map, QTLs and candidate genes will be helpful in understanding and improving the fruit quality traits of strawberry.

Introduction

The cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa), an economically important berry crop, is favored across the globe due to its characteristic aesthetic property, flavor, nutritional value and health benefitting anti-oxidative content (Alvarez-Suarez et al. 2014; Henning et al. 2010). The increasing popularity of the fruit is evident from 21.21% and 57.1% increase in global cultivation area and production, respectively, during the last decade (FAOSTAT 2017). The increasing demand for the fruit necessitates the improvement of both agronomic and fruit quality attributes of the crop. Wider understanding of the genetic determinants of these traits are thus very important. However, compared to other economically important fruits, genetic control of key traits of cultivated strawberry is yet to be completely understood.

Fragaria × ananassa has undergone complex evolutionary changes during its evolutionary journey starting from wild diploid progenitors to the current cultivated octoploid (2n = 8 ×  = 56) species (Potter et al. 2000). Evidences from recent studies indicate three diploid progenitors namely, F. vesca, F. nubicola and F. orientalis; or F. orientalis, F. iinumae and F. vesca or F. mandshurica (Edger et al. 2019; Rousseau-Gueutin and Gaston 2009), which ultimately lead to the extant octoploid species with four relatively similar sub-genomic components (Rousseau-Gueutin and Gaston 2009; Sargent et al. 2016; Tennessen et al. 2014). The genome composition of the current Fragaria × ananassa is proposed to be either AABBBBCC, AAA′A′BBBB, or AAA′A′BBB′B′, with the latter being supported by most of the studies (Isobe et al. 2013; Kunihisa 2011; Sargent et al. 2012; Shaw 1997). The complexity of the genetics of this species thus can be attributed to the various combinations of gene interactions between the multiple alleles, complex meiotic behaviors and highly heterozygous nature of the species (Lerceteau-Köhler et al. 2003; Rousseau-Gueutin et al. 2008; Spigler et al. 2010; Weebadde et al. 2008).

The complex octoploid genomic structure made it difficult to disentangle the species genetically (Sánchez-Sevilla et al. 2015). However, the recent release of Fragaria × ananassa scaffolds in 2014 (Hirakawa et al. 2014) and the release of the complete genome of its diploid progenitor F. vesca (a simper model species) in 2011 (Shulaev et al. 2011) have facilitated the genetic mapping of economically important traits of cultivated strawberry. Genetic mapping of various important traits, particularly prior to the release of complete and annotated genome, can facilitate the identification of the causal loci (and specific genes, in some cases). For polyploid species, genetic mapping is also helpful in identifying the homoeoalleles and their contribution in governing the complex trait, for example, the identification of homoeoalleles for drought resistance in durum wheat (Peleg et al. 2009) and for cane yield in sugarcane (Aitken et al. 2006). Several homoeologous linkage groups have also been identified in the octoploid cultivated strawberry as well (Rousseau-Gueutin et al. 2008; Sargent et al. 2009).

Linkage mapping in strawberry have initially been constructed with low density non-transferrable markers such as single dose restriction fragment (SDRF) markers in ‘Capitola’ × ‘CF1116’ population (Lerceteau-Köhler et al. 2003) and AFLP markers in ‘Tribute’ × ‘Honeoye’ population (Weebadde et al. 2008). These were followed by the use of a comprehensive suite of sequence characterized and transferrable markers such as RAPD markers in ‘Ever Berry’ × ‘Toyonoka’ population (Sugimoto et al. 2005), combination of AFLP, RAPD, SSR and gene specific markers in ‘Redgauntlet’ × ‘Hapil’ population (Sargent et al. 2009) and combination of SSR, STS and SCAR markers in the extended ‘Capitola’ × ‘CF1116’ population (Rousseau-Gueutin et al. 2008). Several QTLs for various agronomic, reproductive and fruit quality traits have already been identified using these populations (Lerceteau-Köhler et al. 2012; Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al. 2011; Lerceteau-Kohler et al. 2006; Castro and Lewers 2016; Verma et al. 2017). However, the need for high-density linkage maps and finer mapping of QTLs with markers saturating the whole genome were realized by several investigators (Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al. 2011; Castro et al. 2015; Pott et al. 2000).

The draft scaffold of Fragaria × ananassa have shown high collinearity with its diploid progenitor, F. vesca (Rousseau-Gueutin and Gaston 2009; Sargent et al. 2012; Hirakawa et al. 2014). This offers the opportunity to develop genome-wide molecular markers and to construct linkage maps with higher marker density. Moreover, the advancement in the cost-effective and readily available reduced genome sequencing technologies such as restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) made the identification of the genome-wide SNPs, for this complex octoploid species, more convenient these days (Elshire et al. 2011; Baird et al. 2008). These genome-wide SNPs are helpful in constructing high-density linkage map, which can eventually lead to the identification of novel QTLs and putative functional candidate genes for both diploid and polyploid species (Bassil et al. 2015; Shirasawa et al. 2017). Although, few reports of SNP based linkage mapping in strawberry are available (Sánchez-Sevilla et al. 2015; Davik et al. 2015; Hossain et al. 2019; Vining et al. 2017), no SNP based QTL is reported yet, particularly for fruit quality traits.

In this study, we thus aimed at identifying genome-wide SNPs via ddRAD-seq technique, constructing high density linkage map and mapping QTLs for few fruit quality traits using the F1 population raised by crossing two cultivars having contrasting agronomic and economic traits. The findings will enrich our current genome wide SNP knowledgebase for cultivated strawberry and will add new insight in understanding the genetics of the studied fruit quality traits.



Discussion

This study describes construction of high-density linkage map and detection of QTLs for key fruit quality reated traits using genome-wide SNPs derived ddRAD-seq technique from a mapping population raised from ‘Maehyang’ and ‘Festival’ (M × F). These two cultivars were chosen based on their contrasting characteristics for a number of agronomic and fruit quality traits and for their diverse geographical origin and adaptation. The variety, Maehyang is a relatively new Korean cultivar originated from ‘Tochinomine’ × ‘Akihime’ and is highly valued for its vigorous and erect type growth, weak dormancy, long, conical and red colored fruit, high sugar content, resistance to powdery mildew and relatively high marketable yield (Kim et al. 2004). ‘Festival’, on the other hand, is a US patented variety developed from hand-pollinated cross of ‘Rosa Linda’ and ‘Oso Grande’ and is characterized by profuse runnering habit, large calyces, long fruit pedicel, firm fleshed, flavorful, deep red, large fruits having soluble sugar content comparatively less than that of ‘Maehyang’(Chandler 2004).

Transgressive segregation of fruit quality traits

Transgressive segregations were observed for diameter and weight of fruits in F1 population. Such transgressive segregations have been reported in intra-specific levels such as Oryza sativa, Cucumis melo, Lolium perenne and Pisum sativum etc. (Mao et al. 2011); in inter-specific level such as Oryza, Prunus and Solanum etc. (Gutiérrez et al. 2010; Quilot et al. 2004) and in polyploids such as Triticum durum (Maccaferri et al. 2011) and Saccharum (Ming et al. 2001). The allelic combinations of the genetically distant parents having complementary gene action could possibly be a reason behind such extreme F1 phenotypes in our study. Besides, potential epistatic interactions between the multiple alleles of this high-ploidy species may contribute to the dominance or over-dominance effect which results in such transgressive segregants (Coelho et al. 2007; Flagel and Wendel 2009). Nonetheless, such transgressive phenotypic expressions in crossing population of this species could be exploited for developing high performing varieties.

Linkage map of ‘Maehyang’ × ‘Festival’ population

The constructed 53 LGs spanned a total genetic distance of 2937.93 cM with an average marker density of 2.14 cM per locus in M × F population. This marker density and physical span is greater than the previously reported linkage maps (Isobe et al. 2013; Lerceteau-Köhler et al. 2003; Rousseau-Gueutin et al. 2008; Weebadde et al. 2008; Sargent et al. 2009; Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al. 2011; Castro et al. 2015; Dijk et al. 2014). Among the SNP marker based linkage groups, Davik et al. mapped 907 markers in 31 linkage groups which spanned 1581.5 cM in 145 F1 hybrid of Sonata (♀) × Babette (♂) population that is estimated to resolve 79% of Fragaria × ananassa genome. In the linkage map of ‘232’ × ‘1392’ population, Sánchez-Sevilla et al. mapped 2089 SNP markers in 33 LGs which spanned a total of 2489.56 cM. Recently, Vining et al. mapped 1163 SNPs in the ‘Tribute (29 LG)’ × ‘Honeoye (33 LG)’ population, 2136 SNPs in ‘Holiday (38 LG)’ × ‘Korona (49 LG)’ population and the highest 3,912 SNPs in ‘Redgauntlet (39 LG)’ × ‘Hapil (37 LG)’ population. The higher number of mapped SNPs in the latter population could be attributed to the fact that SNPs were detected by aligning the raw reads against F. vesca reference genome directly, instead of Fragaria × ananassa genome. Whereas SNPs of our work was detected by aligning the raw reads against Fragaria × ananassa reference genome (FAN_r1.1). The total coverage of 96.36% of the latest diploid F. vesca genome by the mapped markers and high degree of collinearity between the LG-wise markers along the length of the corresponding F. vesca chromosomes further indicate towards the robustness of the constructed linkage map. The constructed linkage maps, thus may assist in future QTL mapping for various important traits in different genetic backgrounds and agro-ecological environments.

QTLs for fruit growth and quality traits

Altogether eighteen QTLs; six for FL and four for FD, FW and SSC each were identified in the M × F population (Fig. 2; Table 2). Most of the QTLs were also detected by the multi-locus mixed linear models such as mrMLM, pLARmEB and ISIS EM-BLASSO (Tamba et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2016; Wen et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2017). For FL, Lerceteau-Köhler et al. identified similar number of QTLs for FD. For FW, however, Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al. identified two and Lerceteau-Köhler et al. identified three QTLs in ‘232’ × ‘1392’ and ‘Capitola’ × ‘CF1116’ populations, respectively. Compared to our four QTLs for fruit SSC, three QTLs have been identified by three independent studies (Lerceteau-Köhler et al. 2012; Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al. 2011; Castro and Lewers 2016). In these three studies, QTLs were identified based on AFLP, SSR and SCAR markers. The use of few common markers facilitated the comparison of the constructed linkage groups and identified that a number of QTLs were actually located on homeologous linkage groups, suggesting common genetic control of related traits in multiple backgrounds (Pott et al. 2000). The QTLs of this study were, however, based on genome-wide SNP based markers, thus could not be directly compared with those previous reports.

QTLs detected for total SSC in fruits in this study are fewer compared to the cumulative number of previously identified QTLs for individual sugar compounds such as sucrose, glucose and fructose by Lerceteau-Köhler et al.. The higher proportion of phenotypic variations (23–50%) explained by the QTLs for SSC, in contrast to the smaller proportions of phenotypic variations explained by the QTLs for individual sugar components, provides a possible explanation for this. Besides SSC, the titratable acidity (TA) and their delicate ratio determines the flavor of strawberry fruits, requiring the selection of fruits that have suitable balance between sweetness and tartness. Several QTLs for TA and SSC/TA has previously been reported to be collocated with the QTLs for SSC (Lerceteau-Köhler et al. 2012; Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al. 2011; Castro and Lewers 2016; Vallarino and Pott 2019). However, the significant but low correlation co-efficient value between these two traits suggested the possibility of independent selection of each of the traits (Castro and Lewers 2016). Overall, identification of several QTLs for a particular trait, each explaining a small individual proportion of the total phenotypic variation indicates complex quantitative inheritance and multi-loci control of these traits (Lerceteau-Köhler et al. 2012; Pott et al. 2000; Paran and Knaap 2007).

Correlation analysis indicated that fruit length is positively correlated with fruit weight, and both these attributes are negatively correlated with fruit SSC (Table S5). This has practical breeding implication in the sense that selection for one trait might negatively affect the selection of another trait. Careful consideration of this point will be necessary for breeding schemes aiming at improving fruit size and fruit sugar contents.

Distribution of QTLs within the linkage map

Among the 53 linkage groups, only 14 hosted all the 18 detected QTLs with LG1B2 hosting maximum four, and LG2B, LG4B and LG5A2 hosting two QTLs each (Fig. 2). Moreover, QTLs for FD and FW co-localized in two linkage groups such as QTLs qFD-1B2.1 and qFW-1B2.2 on LG1B2, and QTLs qFD-4B and qFW-4D on LG4B. The high and significant correlation between these traits (R = 0.512, p value = 0.003) in the F1 population also indicates potential control by the common genetic regions, possibly by same or tightly linked genes (Table S5). Besides the two co-located QTLs, LG1B2 hosts two more QTLs, qFW-1B2.1 for FW and qFD-1B2.2 for FD (total four QTLs throughout the length of this LG). This indicates that this chromosomal region may be the key genetic determinants of these fruit growth and size related traits. A previous study has reported one-fourth of fruit quality related QTLs to be clustered in two linkage groups where QTLs for fruit shape, diameter and weight were particularly found to be co-located (Lerceteau-Köhler et al. 2012). In our population, sugar content related QTL, qSSC-2B and FD related QTL, qFD-2B were found to be very closely located on LG2B, even though no significant correction (R = 0.46, p value = 0.13) were observed for these two traits.

Such QTL clusters have also been observed in strawberry for anthocyanin content, antioxidant property (Castro and Lewers 2016), fruit numbers, yield and quality traits (Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al. 2011), and for various fruit quality traits in other crops including pepper, tomato and for fiber development related traits in cotton (Ring et al. 2013; Fulton et al. 1997; Saliba-Colombani et al. 2001). QTL clusters, in genetic terms, suggest the intricately regulated gene networks with potential pleotropic effects; while in breeding terms, indicate the possibility of selection for multiple traits, simultaneously.

Candidate genes for fruit growth and size related traits

The key candidate genes within the QTL regions for fruit size related traits such as length, diameter and weight of fruits include transcription factors (TF), and plant growth and development related genes (Tables S7 and S8). Several closely linked QTL marker genes encoded some important TFs such as FAN_iscf00104879.1—‘Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 12’ (marker MF3023 of QTL qFL-6C1), FAN_iscf00387732.1—‘Serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 1’ (marker MF2104 linked to qFL-3B1), both the flanking marker genes, FAN_iscf00275054.1—‘Transcription factor TFIIIB component B’ and FAN_iscf00135334.1—‘Transcriptional activator DEMETER’ (flanking markers MF1601 and MF994 of QTL qFD-2B) and FAN_iscf00266073.1 – ‘putative receptor protein kinase ZmPK1’ (MF332 of QTL qFW-6A2), etc.

Auxin play important role in the early stages of strawberry fruit development where the receptacle growth is dependent on auxin delivery from the achenes. Auxin biosynthesis is dependent on tryptophan aminotransferase (TAA and TAR) and flavin-dependent monooxygenases (YUCCA) enzymes (Pattison et al. 2014; Stepanova et al. 2011). In woodland strawberry genome, four tryptophan aminotransferases (TAA) have been identified and in cultivated strawberry, three genes namely, FaTAA1, FaTAR1, and FaTAR2 were expressed in fruits (Estrada-Johnson et al. 2017). In our population, several tryptophan aminotransferase genes including FaTAA1 (FvH4_4g25850.1) and FaTAA2 (FvH4_7g02760.1) were found within FW related QTL qFW-4B and FL related QTL qFL-7A1, respectively. In addition, within the sugar content related QTL qSSC-5A21, three tryptophan aminotransferase genes (FvH4_5g05900.1, FvH4_5g05880.1, and FvH4_5g05890.1) were found. Six auxin responsive genes (FvH4_1g09150.1, FvH4_3g21460.1, FvH4_3g23200.1, FvH4_4g22430.1, FvH4_4g23230.1 and FvH4_5g27860.1) and six auxin efflux carrier genes (FvH4_5g26320.1, FvH4_5g26370.1, FvH4_5g26330.1, FvH4_6g35590.1, FvH4_4g32450.1 and FvH4_4g32170.1) were found within FL, FD and FW related QTL regions (Tables S5).

We have identified three cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase genes (FvH4_7g02150.1, FvH4_1g07610.1 and FvH4_1g07620.1) within FL related QTL qFL-7A1. Cytokinin dehydrogenase genes and gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase genes were found to be upregulated in pear fruits whose overexpression is believed to be involved in cytokinin and gibberellin metabolism that largely controls cell division (Jiang et al. 2018) and hence, fruit size. The NAC, ERF and bHLH transcription factors were highly related with cytokinin dehydrogenase and gibberellin dioxygenase genes (Jiang et al. 2018). The SlKLUH gene encoding a P450 enzyme of the CYP78A subfamily within a major QTL (fw3.2) for tomato fruit size/weight is believed to be involved in enlarging fruit volume through an increase in cell number within the pericarp and septum tissues (Azzi et al. 2015; Chakrabarti et al. 2013).

Four genes (FvH4_6g34910.1, FvH4_6g34950.1, FvH4_7g09250.1 and FvH4_7g09260.1) within FL related QTLs, 10 genes (FvH4_4g29160.1, FvH4_4g29370.1, FvH4_4g29410.1, FvH4_4g29420.1, FvH4_4g29430.1, FvH4_4g29440.1, FvH4_4g29450.1, FvH4_4g29480.1, FvH4_4g29490.1 and FvH4_4g29500.1) within FD related QTLs and 16 genes (FvH4_1g03910.1, FvH4_1g08780.1, FvH4_1g08790.1, FvH4_1g08830.1, FvH4_4g22540.1, FvH4_4g22550.1, FvH4_4g29160.1, FvH4_4g29370.1, FvH4_4g29410.1, FvH4_4g29420.1, FvH4_4g29430.1, FvH4_4g29440.1, FvH4_4g29450.1, FvH4_4g29480.1, FvH4_4g29490.1 and FvH4_4g29500.1) within FW related QTLs encoding for P450 enzyme were found in our study.

Candidate genes and molecular marker for sugar content

A total of 2007 genes were found within the SSC related QTL regions of which 13 genes may have role in sugar metabolism (Tables S6 and S8). The flanking marker MF472 of QTL qSSC-2B is found within the UDP-glucosyltransferase gene (FAN_iscf00049825.1). One glucose-6-phosphate gene (FANhyb_rscf00000021.1.g00018.1—FaGlu8) in addition to ‘UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase’ and ‘UDP-glucose 4-epimerase GEPI48-like gene’ (FANhyb_rscf00000538.1.g00003.1- FaGlu15) were very recently shown to be upregulated in ripe fruits of high sugar cultivars, Shanmugam et al. and one ‘glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator 1’ gene (FaGPT1) were also recently found to be expressed in mature fruits of high sugar cultivars, Geumsil, Aram, Maehyang and Okmae (Lee et al. 2018). The flanking marker MF472 of QTL qSSC-2B is harbored in ‘UDP-glucosyltransferase gene’ (FAN_iscf00049825.1) which may have direct roles in sugar biosynthesis (Tables S7 and S8).

The invertases irreversibly hydrolyze sucrose to glucose and fructose and thus play crucial roles in carbohydrate partitioning and plant development (Chen et al. 2015). Three invertase genes namely, FaINVG-1, FaINVA-3 and FacwINV2-1 were recently found to show higher expressions in high sugar-content cultivars (Lee et al. 2018). However, none of these are found within our QTL regions. Instead, the seven invertase family genes, of which three are neutral/alkaline invertases, were found within our QTL regions (Tables S7 and S8). These genes may have roles in sugar metabolism.

In addition, a HRM marker (MF154) was developed based on the SNP A1723G of the UDP-glucose 4-epimerase GEPI48-like gene FAN_iscf00021287 for selecting high vs low sugar containing genotpes. The gene was located within the QTL qSSC5A2.1 on linkage group LG5A2 and was found to be a key gene regulating sugar biosynthesis in progressively ripening strawberry fruits (Shanmugam et al. 2017). Evaluation of the influence of allelic difference of the developed HRM marker (MF154) for fruit SSC on fruit weight in the segregating F1 population via general linear model revealed that there is no significant influence of allelic difference of fruit SSC on the fruit weight. This is understandable, since multiple non-collocating QTLs with minor effects were identified for these two traits indicating that different sets of genes, each with minor effects, may be acting on these two traits. In breeding terms, this indicate that selection for fruit SSC is independent of selection for fruit weight in this population.
