
Abstract

Trichoderma spp., a cosmopolitan fungal genus, has remarkable economic value in industry and agriculture. The resources of Trichoderma spp. in the grassland and forest ecosystems of northern Xinjiang were explored in this study. A total of 634 soil samples was collected, and 312 strains assigned to 23 species of Trichoderma spp. were identified. T. harzianum was the dominant species with 28.2% from all isolates. The principal components analysis indicated that ecosystem was the most dominant impact factor among longitude, latitude, altitude and ecosystems for the species diversities of Trichoderma spp. with the decreasing trend from the north to the south of northern Xinjiang (e.g., from Altay, followed by Yili, Changji, Bayingolin and finally Urumqi). Overall, Trichoderma spp. were more frequently encountered in forest ecosystems (coniferous forest and coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest) than in grassland ecosystems (desert steppe and temperate steppe). Frequency of Trichoderma spp. was significantly decreased along with increased altitude and only a few strains were isolated from altitudes above 3000 m. The results provided essential information on Trichoderma occurrence and distribution, which should benefit the application of Trichoderma in agriculture.

Introduction

As a cosmopolitan fungal genus, Trichoderma (Ascomycetes, Hypocreales) spp. are found in different environments, such as soil, above-ground plants, fungal material, decaying wood, sediment, and various other substances (Cummings et al. 2016; Harman 2000; Jaklitsch 2009; Jaklitsch and Voglmayr 2015; Kubicek et al. 2008). Many studies have been published about promising applications of Trichoderma spp. in industry and agriculture due to their ability to produce enzymes and antibiotics, promote plant growth, induce plant resistance (Gajera et al. 2015; Mukherjee et al. 2013; Ortega-García et al. 2015; Vitti et al. 2016), and enhance the efficiency of nutrient use (Kashyap et al. 2017). In particular, Trichoderma strains are significant biocontrol agents against plant fungal pathogens(Bae et al. 2016; El-Hassan et al. 2013; Harman et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2015a, b).

Recently, biodiversity of Trichoderma has been extensively investigated in different countries and regions, including Russia, Siberia, the Himalayas (Kullnig et al. 2000), a mid-European area (Wuczkowski et al. 2003), Egypt (Gherbawy et al. 2004), Tenerife (Zachow et al. 2009a, b), Colombia (Hoyos-Carvajal et al. 2009), Iran (Naeimi et al. 2011), South-East Asian (Kubicek et al. 2003), Manipur (Kamala et al. 2015), Southern Europe and Macaronesia (Jaklitsch and Voglmayr 2015), Malaysian Borneo (Cummings et al. 2016), and New Zealand (Braithwaite et al. 2017). These studies focused on the species diversity, phylogeny, geographic distribution, and habitat preference of Trichoderma as well as the effect of collection season and crop type on the distribution of Trichoderma spp. (Chaverri and Samuels 2013; Jiang et al. 2016; Kubicek et al. 2008). In China, species diversity and the distribution of Trichoderma have been investigated nationwide since the 1990s (Wen et al. 1993). Zhang et al. identified northern China as a potential center of origin of a unique haplotype of T. harzianum (Zhang et al. 2005a, b). Sun et al. further identified 23 Trichoderma spp. with significant ecological, biochemical, and genetic diversity in north, southwest, southeast, and middle China,and found that T. harzianum was the most widely distributed species in China, and the highest biodiversity of Trichoderma populations occurred in southwest China (Sun et al. 2012). In 2016, Jiang et al. surveyed Trichoderma biodiversity of 17 species in agricultural fields in four provinces of eastern China (Jiang et al. 2016).

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in Northwestern China (73°E–96°E, 34°N–48°N) covers an area of 1.66 million square kilometers, and has rich natural resources because of its unique geographical and ecological environment, complex and diverse landforms and soils. Tianshan and Altai Mountains in northern Xinjiang are also covered with luxuriantly green primary forests and vast grasslands. The complex terrain and diverse ecological environment in this region provide capacity for Trichoderma spp. biodiversity. However, no system research have been conducted on the diversity of Trichoderma spp. In this study, we focused on the recovery of Trichoderma diversities in grassland (desert steppe and temperate steppe) and forest (coniferous forest and coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest) ecosystems of northern Xinjiang based on altitudes, longitude, latitude and ecosystems.
