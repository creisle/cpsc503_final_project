
Abstract

The family GH126 is a family of glycoside hydrolases established in 2011. Officially, in the CAZy database, it counts ~ 1000 sequences originating solely from bacterial phylum Firmicutes. Two members, the proteins CPF_2247 from Clostridium perfringens and PssZ from Listeria monocytogenes have been characterized as a probable α-amylase and an exopolysaccharide-specific glycosidase, respectively; their three-dimensional structures being also solved as possessing catalytic (α/α)6-barrel fold. Previously, based on a detailed in silico analysis, the seven conserved sequence regions (CSRs) were identified for the family along with elucidating basic evolutionary relationships within the family members. The present study represents a continuation study focusing on two particular aims: to find out whether the taxonomic coverage of the family GH126 might be extended outside the Firmicutes and, if positive, to deliver those out-of-Firmicutes proteins with putting them into the context of the family; and to identify the family members containing the N- and/or C-terminal extensions of their polypeptide chain, additional to the catalytic (α/α)6-barrel domain, and perform the bioinformatics characterization of the extra domains. The main results could be summarized as follows: 17 bacterial proteins caught by BLAST searches outside Firmicutes (especially from phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes) have been found and convincingly suggested as new family GH126 members; and a thioredoxin-like fold and various leucine-rich repeat motifs identified by Phyre2 structure homology modelling have been recognized as extra domains occurring most frequently in the N-terminal extensions of family GH126 members possessing a modular organization.

Introduction

In the sequence-based classification of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) of the CAZy database (https://www.cazy.org/; Lombard et al. 2014), the family GH126 was established after the study by Ficko-Blean et al. delivering the three-dimensional structure and partial characterization as a potential α-amylase of the protein CPF_2247 from Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124 genome (Myers et al. 2006). The structure was solved as that of a typical catalytic (α/α)6-barrel fold known, e.g., in the family GH15 glucoamylases (Sauer et al. 2000; Kumar and Satyanarayana 2009; Marin-Navarro and Polaina 2011), but adopted neither by α-amylases from families GH13 and GH57 and even in GH119 (Janecek and Kuchtova 2012; Janecek et al. 2014; Martinovicova and Janecek 2018), nor by β-amylases from family GH14 (Monroe and Storm 2018).

The situation concerning the knowledge of the family GH126 is really intriguing since based on the information available about the family (Lombard et al. 2014), it has not been possible to state definitively whether or not this family can be added to CAZy α-amylase families GH13, GH57 and GH119 established previously (Janecek et al. 2014). Currently (July 2020), the family GH126 counts more than 1000 sequenced bacterial members exclusively from the phylum Firmicutes (Lombard et al. 2014). The three-dimensional structure has been solved for two of them, the above-mentioned CPF_2247 amylolytic enzyme from C. perfringens (Ficko-Blean et al. 2011) and the PssZ protein from Listeria monocytogenes (Wu et al. 2019). Interestingly, only the former is indicated as biochemically characterized enzyme in CAZy (Lombard et al. 2014); the latter, however, being also partially characterized, i.e., as a glycosidase able to degrade the specific exopolysaccharide of the biofilm matrix consisting of the N-acetylmannosamine and galactose in a ratio 2:1 (Koseoglu et al. 2015). It is of note that although the authors of both crucial studies (Koseoglu et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2019) have identified the PssZ protein as the member of the family GH8, the CAZy curators have classified it obviously into the family GH126 (Lombard et al. 2014). The uncertainties of the most appropriate CAZy GH family affiliation of the PssZ protein are understandable, because both the CPF_2247 amylolytic enzyme and PssZ protein exhibit a pronounced structural relatedness not only to family GH8, but also to GH48, with which the GH8 forms the CAZy clan GH-M (Alzari et al. 1996; Parsiegla et al. 1998; Guerin et al. 2002; Guimares et al. 2002). The close structural relatedness concerns also putative active-site residues in GH126 (Ficko-Blean et al. 2011) including the general catalytic acid (Glu84; the CPF_2247 protein numbering). The fact that the members of the clan GH-M (i.e., families GH8 and GH48) represent the inverting β-glucan-active GHs (Henrissat and Davies 1997; Lombard et al. 2014; CAZypedia Consortium 2018) should be carefully considered, especially, if the possibility is taken into account, too, the CPF_2247 amylolytic enzyme may be an α-amylase (Ficko-Blean et al. 2011), i.e., the retaining and α-glucan-active enzyme (Janecek et al. 2014).

With the aim to shed some light on the overall view of the family GH126 and its eventual relationships to other GH families, its detailed in silico analysis has recently been accomplished (Kerenyiova and Janecek 2020), delivering for the first time the seven conserved sequence regions (CSRs) defined for the family as well as its division into two basic evolutionary groups represented by two best studied GH126 members—the CPF_2247 amylolytic enzyme from C. perfringens (Ficko-Blean et al. 2011) and the PssZ protein from L. monocytogenes (Wu et al. 2019). Amylolytic enzymes are, in general, typical modular GHs, possessing, in addition to catalytic domain, also other modules—some contributing with a characteristic function, some seemingly without playing any special role or with a role not recognized as yet (Kuchtova and Janecek 2016; Da Lage 2017; Valk et al. 2017). Among them, the best known and studied module is represented by starch-binding domains (SBD; Janecek et al. 2011), classified in CAZy among the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) families (Lombard et al. 2014). Until now, 15 SBD CBM families have already been established in CAZy; some additional ones are obviously waiting to be confirmed experimentally that may potentially define new CBM families (Janecek et al. 2019).

Among the family GH126 members, only a few of its members do possess some extra N- and/or C-terminal extensions of their polypeptide chain, i.e., they are mostly formed just by their catalytic (α/α)6-barrel domain (Kerenyiova and Janecek 2020). Moreover, from the taxonomical point of view, the family GH126 is a sole prokaryotic—more specifically—bacterial (i.e., not archaeal) family; its members being originating from the phylum Firmicutes only (Lombard et al. 2014; Kerenyiova and Janecek 2020). The present study was, therefore, performed in an effort: to find out reliably whether or not the taxonomic coverage of the family GH126 can be expanded outside Firmicutes; and to characterize by the in silico approaches involving homology modelling and structure comparison the most typical N- and/or C-terminal sequence extensions observed in some extant family GH126 members. The obtained results could thus add another piece of mosaic into the overall picture of this potential α-amylase family.
