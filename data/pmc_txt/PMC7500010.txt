Abstract

An automated method for the generation of curved layer toolpaths is demonstrated to produce 3D printed components with improved aesthetic and structural properties using fused filament fabrication printing. Three case studies are shown, which demonstrate the ability of the G-code generating algorithm to resolve concave and convex structures. The combination of conventionally printed layers and curved layers within a single print is also demonstrated by producing double skin curved layer sandwich structures with static z printed cores. Clear improvements in the surface finish of printed components using curved layer fused filament fabrication are shown visually.
