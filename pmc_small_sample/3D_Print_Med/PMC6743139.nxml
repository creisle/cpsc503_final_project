For cartilage applications, hydrogels as soft materials must show some degree of rigidity, which can be achieved by photo- or chemical polymerization. In this work, we combined chemical and UV laser polymeric cross-linkage to control the mechanical properties of 3D printed hydrogel blends. Since there are few studies on UV laser cross-linking combined with 3D printing of hydrogels, the work here reported offered many challenges.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), sodium alginate (SA) and calcium sulphate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) polymer paste containing riboflavin (vitamin B2) and triethanolamine (TEOHA) as a biocompatible photoinitiator was printed in an extrusion 3D plotter using a coupled UV laser. The influence of the laser power on the mechanical properties of the printed samples was then examined in unconfined compression stress-strain tests of 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1&#x02009;cm<sup>3</sup> sized samples. To evaluate the adhesion of the material between printed layers, compression measurements were performed along the parallel and perpendicular directions to the printing lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">At a laser density of 70&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, Young&#x02019;s modulus was approximately 6&#x02009;MPa up to a maximum compression of 20% in the elastic regime for both the parallel and perpendicular measurements. These values were within the range of biological cartilage values. Cytotoxicity tests performed with Vero cells confirmed the cytocompatibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">We printed a partial tracheal model using optimized printing conditions and proved that the materials and methods developed may be useful for printing of organ models to support surgery or even to produce customized tracheal implants, after further optimization.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s41205-019-0049-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>3D printing</kwd><kwd>Biopolymer</kwd><kwd>In-situ UV laser polymerization</kwd><kwd>Mechanical properties</kwd><kwd>Tracheal 3D model</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>647596</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferreira</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010667</institution-id><institution>H2020 Industrial Leadership</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TransFlexTeg-645241</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>FEDER funds through the COMPETE 2020 Program and National Funds through FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology </institution></funding-source><award-id>UID/CTM/50025/2013, UID/QUI/50006/2013 and Pest-UID/FIS/00068/2013</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par14">There are several potential health-related applications of 3D printing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], most of which are in the field of neurosurgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], orthopaedics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], spinal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], maxillofacial surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], tissue engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], indirect fabrication of medical devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], cell seeding and culturing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and cranial surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], where 3D printing can be used to print the final implant. 3D printing can also be used as an aid in 3D models to help visualize complex medical cases, in addition to assisting student teaching and patient education also allows health professionals to practice certain procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which can be complemented by the fabrication of anatomical models for pre-surgical planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. 3D printing of customized prosthetics to replace damaged regions of bones, organs, cartilage or tissue is in high demand to enable prosthesis integration. However, resolution of 3D printing technologies is not a limiting factor, there is a need for new biocompatible materials that can fulfil the required specificities of different applications, such as cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Hydrogels are cross-linked networks of hydrophilic polymers, which are capable of absorbing water up to thousands of times their dry weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. They are also biocompatible and can be delivered into the body through minimally invasive methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although hydrogels are the most extensively studied materials for cartilage replacement, implants with properties that mimic natural cartilage are some way off. Several ways to obtain hydrogels in a 3D form have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Commonly used methods include dispensing two reactive components using mixing nozzles, inducing cross-linkage through heat or UV light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or delivering one material to a plotting reactive medium to finish the curing reaction. Hydrogels can be fabricated in various ways, such as radiation, freeze-thawing, chemical cross-linking or thermal annealing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some examples of biocompatible hydrogels are polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), which is a blank slate hydrogel that jellifies rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a photoinitiator and UV light. Since PEGDA gels are hydrophilic and elastic, and can be mixed with a variety of biological molecules, they constitute powerful tools for bioprinting. PEGDA gels are also biologically inert, and their mechanical properties can be adjusted over a large range of Young&#x02019;s moduli. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and alginate are other hydrogels widely used in biomedical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The mechanical properties of PVA can be enhanced by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Alginate becomes a hydrogel when an aqueous alginate solution is mixed with divalent cations due to ionic cross-linking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The blocks of guluronate in alginate chains bind to the divalent cations, and a gel structure forms by the junction of functional groups from separated polymer chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The cross-linking of hydrogels is essential to provide stability, flexibility and support the required strength of applications. That is possible when established bonds and networks are resilient to the breakage of covalent bonds.</p><p id="Par16">Composite hydrogels obtained by chemical cross-linkage of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and physical cross-linkage of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) have been investigated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As compared with pure PVA hydrogels, which have tensile strength of only 0.17&#x02009;MPa at ultimate elongation of 312%, the incorporation of chemically cross-linked PEG improves the tensile strength with the increasing PEG content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There has been little research on 3D printing by extrusion of pastes combined with in situ UV laser light cross-linking or the use of riboflavin-triethanolamine (TEOHA) mixtures as photoinitiators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Nguyen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] recently demonstrated the polymerization of a mixture containing PEGDA (as the polymer), riboflavin (as the photoinitiator) and TEOHA (as the co-initiator) using two-photon polymerization and a stereolithography printing technique. Pre- or post-printing cross-linking has been attempted previously. The former consists of focusing UV light on a container, usually a syringe, whereas the latter involves focusing UV light on already printed materials. However, UV light through the extrusion region requires a transparent nozzle/needle and a cross-linking variant in situ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In this work, we studied the 3D extrusion of pastes containing PEGDA, sodium alginate (SA) and a photoinitiator (B2VT) consisting of a solution of riboflavin and TEOHA using a UV laser coupled to a syringe that contained the polymer mixture to be printed. This work focused on the influence of laser power on the mechanical properties of the printed samples and its optimization. In the approach applied, after each hydrogel printed layer, the UV laser scanned the printed region at the same speed as the paste extrusion. A 3D model of a trachea was printed under optimized conditions, including a segment of a life-sized trachea. This work demonstrates that it is possible to print models that can be used as an aid to surgery and to print customized implants after further improvements and studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ink preparation</title><p id="Par18">Ink gels for 3D printing were prepared by mixing 10.8&#x02009;mg of calcium sulphate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>), 1&#x02009;ml of ultrapure water and 2.5&#x02009;ml of 34.78% wt/v PEGDA (Mn&#x02009;=&#x02009;575, Sigma-Aldrich) solution in ultrapure water, 2.5&#x02009;ml of 5% v/v SA (90.8%, Biochemica) solution in ultrapure water and 1&#x02009;ml of B2VT solution. CaSO<sub>4</sub> was weighed before the addition of 1&#x02009;ml of ultrapure water and 2.5&#x02009;ml of the PEGDA solution under constant stirring. Subsequently, while maintaining stirring, 2.5&#x02009;ml of the SA solution were added to enhance cross-linkage of the blend. Finally, the B2VT solution was added to absorb UV radiation, and the mixture was loaded into a 20&#x02009;cc syringe and left to rest in an upright position for up to 12&#x02009;h until the liquid became gel like. The B2VT solution (10&#x02009;ml) was prepared as follows: 9.5&#x02009;mg of riboflavin (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 3.1&#x02009;g of TEOHA (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10&#x02009;ml of ultrapure water. The materials were placed in separate containers and weighed. Ultrapure water (5&#x02009;ml) was then added to each container under magnetic stirring. Both solutions were kept at room temperature. After stirring for 30&#x02009;min, the two solutions were mixed together and stirred for another 30&#x02009;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Printing procedure</title><p id="Par19">A home-made 3D plotter was built [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] by integrating a syringe controlled by compressed air and a UV laser (3.8&#x02009;W laser head, JTech Photonics) of variable power up to a maximum of 3.8&#x02009;W. The printing process was performed sequentially, with a printed paste layer followed by laser scanning at the same speed as the printing paste extrusion (15&#x02009;mm/s) and the same line width (0.3&#x02009;mm), with intensities in the range of 0.4 to 2.0&#x02009;W. A 20&#x02009;cc syringe with a 0.3&#x02009;mm needle was used with a pressure of 1.8&#x02009;bar. The samples were designed using Blender and Cura 2.4.0, which created a G-code file that was later read by the printer. In this file, the laser power was determined by a number between 0 and 255, which corresponded to a power range between 0 and 3.8&#x02009;W. The laser emission wavelengths were in the range of 435 to 455&#x02009;nm, which included one UV-Vis absorption peak of PEGDA/B2VT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

This final file was saved in a .gcode format using Cura 2.4.0. The .gcode file was then altered using software developed to incorporate a UV laser scan between each printed layer.

The yield deformation decreased, and deformation was more pronounced when the compression force was applied perpendicularly to the plane of the printed layers (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).</p><p id="Par27">The average mechanical parameters (i.e. Young&#x02019;s modulus, yield strength and ultimate compressive strength) obtained from the measurements of the five different samples in the parallel and perpendicular compression tests as a function of the laser power are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.

Thus, Young&#x02019;s modulus can be considered to be almost isotropic and independent of the laser power, suggesting that a homogeneous polymer mixture and cross-linking were achieved at laser power in the range of 400&#x02013;1600&#x02009;mW. Outside this range (below 400&#x02009;mW), it was impossible to obtain a solid object, and cross-linking of PEGDA was incomplete. Consequently, the gel spread when the layers were superposed.</p><p id="Par31">Laser power above 1700&#x02009;mW led to brittle 3D samples. High laser energy caused point defects or glass transition of the polymers, which resulted in fragile regions in the samples at the site of failure, leading to a marked decrease in yield strength. Laser power in the range of 600&#x02013;1000&#x02009;mW was optimum for maximizing the mechanical properties and cross-linking of the layers. Uniform and isotropic E values of 6&#x02013;7&#x02009;MPa and yield strength of 0.7&#x02013;0.8&#x02009;MPa were obtained within this power laser range. Above this laser power, the maximum strength decreased on average, and the difference between the parallel and perpendicular values increased. The linear deformation reached 20% at laser power up to 900&#x02009;mW but decreased to 15% or lower at higher laser powers. Contrary to the stiffness values, the ultimate strength showed anisotropy between the parallel and perpendicular measurements. When stress was applied parallel to the layers, the weak region of the samples was the layers&#x02019; junction. Thus, when the deformation force was perpendicular to the layers, layer detachment can occur, and the maximum power is affect by the interpenetration and cross-linkage between the printed lines. When these were sufficiently strong, isotropy was solely dependent upon the porosity of the material. However, the variation of perpendicular and parallel strength in the range of 600&#x02013;1000&#x02009;mW was smaller than that observed at a laser power output above 1600&#x02009;mW. The optimized laser power of 600&#x02013;1000&#x02009;mW corresponded to a power density of 42&#x02013;70&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="Par32">In this study, we focused on the mechanical properties of PEGDA, SA and a B2VT mixture with a fixed composition the one that have shown the better gelation properties when extruded by a syringe. Bashir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reported a decrease in the elastic modulus from 500&#x02009;kPa to 5&#x02009;kPa when the molecular weight of PEG increased from 0.7&#x02009;kDa to 10&#x02009;kDa in PEGDA hydrogels printed using a stereolithography technique. Rennerfeldt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] studied the influence of different percentages of PEGDA (10, 20 and 30%) and three molecular weights (2&#x02009;kDa, 3.4&#x02009;kDa and 6&#x02009;kDa) in mechanical compression tests of mould-produced samples containing 0, 2 and 5% agarose. Samples of 0% agarose showed maximum stress of 3&#x02009;MPa with 20% PEGDA and a molecular weight of 6&#x02009;kDa, and the variation in maximum strain was almost independent of the percentage of PEGDA, with increases from 0.6 to 1 when the molecular weight increased from 2&#x02009;kDa to 6&#x02009;kDa. Duan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] described a 3D printed alginate/gelatin hydrogel in a 3D grid of lines about 1 to 2&#x02009;mm apart. In their study, the ultimate tensile strength of the hydrogel decreased from 0.84&#x02009;MPa to 0.12&#x02009;MPa strength, and the elastic modulus decreased from 1.44 to 0.99&#x02009;MPa after 24&#x02009;h of production but remain unchanged for 7&#x02009;days. Yasar and Inceoglu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] studied mechanical compression properties of PEGDA rods made by moulds and UV photopolymerization. In their study, Young&#x02019;s modulus increased from 3.1 to 57&#x02009;MPa, and maximum strength increased from 0.5 to 10&#x02009;MPa in accordance with changes in the percentages of PEGDA in water from 20 to 100%. In a recent study on the mechanical strength of alginate/poly (acrylamide-co-acrylic acid)/Fe<sup>3+</sup>(SA/P (AAm-co-AAc/Fe<sup>3+</sup>), the authors reported tensile strength and strain values of 3.24&#x02009;MPa and 1228%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Eu-containing poly (vinyl acetate) and PVA triple physical cross-linked hydrogels exhibited 2&#x02009;MPa of compressive stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. GelMA hydrogels with a compressive modulus of 288.24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;62.34&#x02009;kPa and Young&#x02019;s modulus of 264.74&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.08&#x02009;kPa at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Cross-linking using photopolymerization requires the use of a photoinitiator. The main advantages of this method are the rapid formation of a hydrogel under room temperature and tuning of the cross-linking reactions by the light exposition time and intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, only the radiated areas are cross-linked, which allows the construction of hydrogels with complex geometries and structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The double bonds of unsaturated groups of some compounds, such as (meth) acrylates, are highly reactive, and excitation with light promotes radical chain-growth polymerization. Examples are reactions of hydroxyl, carboxyl and amino groups of water soluble polymers with acryloyl chloride, glycidymethacrylate forming vinlyl groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For biomedical applications, the photoinitiator must be cytocompatible. The photoinitiators Irgacure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], riboflavin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and eosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] absorb radiation in the UV range of 250&#x02013;370&#x02009;nm and visible range of 405&#x02013;550&#x02009;nm. As UV radiation exposure is considered dangerous to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], a photoinitiator absorbing in the visible range is preferable for cross-linking of hydrogels containing cells. Thus, we used B2T2 in our experiments and added CaSO<sub>4</sub> to in the gel mixture in an attempt to increase the efficiency of cross-linkage of PEGDA. Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] reported a beneficial effect of 0.1&#x02009;M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> on the reduction of temperature and gelation time of a methycellulose hydrogel. A recent research work also showed that divalent cations, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, bound to guluronate blocks of polymer chains and facilitate the junction of guluronate blocks of adjacent polymer chains. Several attempts to enhance the mechanical properties of hydrogels have been reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Some examples include reinforcement of alginate; gelatin hydrogels reinforced with bioglass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and hydroxyapatite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; alginate reinforced with biphasic calcium phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; PEGDA reinforced with hydroxyapatite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; and PEGDA, alginate and gelatin reinforced with laponite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Previous research reported that the mechanical properties of PEGDA hydrogels that mimicked cartilage were highly dependent on the fabrication process. Studies also showed that various factors, such as the UV exposure time, intensity and photoinitiator concentration, influenced PEGDA cross-linking and that the porosity of the film depended on the fabrication method. The surface morphology of our 3D printed samples was dense. The latter may explain the good mechanical properties of the samples. At a higher laser intensity, a failure region occurred perpendicular to the printing lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). As the compressive effort was applied along the same direction, the corresponding shear stresses generated along the print lines must have been responsible for the fracture. Thus, failure of the printed part was due to cohesive failure within each individual layer and not to adhesive failure between the different layers (layer detachment).</p><p id="Par35">In the present work, the mechanical properties obtained in the compression stress tests (Young&#x02019;s modulus of 6&#x02013;8&#x02009;MPa and maximum strength of 7&#x02013;11&#x02009;MPa) were above the range values of biological cartilage (1.9&#x02009;MPa Young&#x02019;s modulus and maximum strength of 3&#x02009;MPa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In future work, we will investigate the influence of variations in porosity on the mechanical strength, together with fabrication parameters. In this study, all the parameters were fixed, except the laser power, and we focused only on the mechanical strength of the printed samples. Future studies will correlate the laser power with sample swelling, as the toughness of samples in contact with body fluids is very important for cartilage applications.</p><p id="Par36">In the present work, several tracheal samples were printed with different wall thicknesses.

The laser power intensity was in the range of 40&#x02013;70&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the scan speed was 15&#x02009;mm/s. This resulted in optimisation of Young&#x02019;s modulus of around 6&#x02013;7&#x02009;MPa, yield strength of 0.7&#x02013;0.8&#x02009;MPa and maximum strength of 7&#x02013;11&#x02009;MPa, which corresponded to yield deformation of 20% and 70% deformation before failure.
