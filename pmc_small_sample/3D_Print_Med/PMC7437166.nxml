Closed reposition and non-operative treatment with casting is complicated by secondary displacement in up to 75% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Secondary displacement refers to displacement of a fracture after manipulation to an anatomic position.</p><p id="Par11">Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an emerging technique that allows for individualized modeling and production. Some start-ups are exploring the development and implementation of 3D printed braces for fracture treatment. Chen et al. published their clinical experience in a group of 10 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Their use of the fractured limb as a template presumes a non-dislocated or perfectly reduced fracture. They started with a classical plaster cast and changed to a 3D printed brace after 1 week when swelling had subsided. No loss of reduction or serious complications were observed. We did not find previous studies using a 3D printed brace for the acute or initial treatment of dislocated DRF.</p><p id="Par12">The aim of this project was to develop a custom-made 3D printed brace that could be used in the acute treatment of dorsally dislocated and correctly reduced DRFs. Focus was on dislocated fractures because non-dislocated fractures are easily treated using less complicated techniques. The hypothesis was that by using the contour of the non-fractured contralateral wrist as a (mirrored) template, a brace with an optimal anatomical fit could be made. With this individualized brace we aimed to improve comfort and reduce secondary fracture displacement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Validation</title><p id="Par13">Before the clinical study three validation studies were performed:</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study of the comparability of both wrists in healthy volunteers</title><p id="Par14">In order to use the contour of the contralateral wrist as a template both wrists must be comparable. We planned to compare the wrists in at least 100 volunteers who were 18&#x02009;years or older and had no former treatment for a wrist fracture. After informed consent was obtained circumference of wrists was measured in millimetres (mm), distally from the styloid at the base of the hand with the wrist in neutral position. Since either side could have the largest circumference, the difference in circumferences of the largest versus that of the smallest wrist was tested with a paired t-test (with <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0,05 considered as statistically significant).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Evaluation of the brace in an ex vivo model</title><p id="Par15">The brace was tested in an ex vivo model using six AnubiFiX&#x000ae;&#x02122; (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) embalmed human specimen.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] modified by retaining the soft tissues: a wedge osteotomy of 10&#x02009;mm dorsal/1&#x02009;mm volar was made 8&#x02009;mm/12&#x02009;mm proximal to the dorsal/volar apex of the articular surface.</p><p id="Par16">The dislocating forces were simulated using the model described by Theeuwes et al.

All volunteers had a maximal Katz score meaning there were no limitations in ADL. Two volunteers had minor skin problems without resulting pain. No severe side effects were noted. A literature search was performed and resulted in no comparative data.</p><p id="Par48">In the clinical study comfort scores were lower and pain scores higher compared to the healthy volunteers as might be expected with a fracture. Patient three reported high pain and poor comfort scores caused by a pressure point on the dorsum of the ulnar head, the same anatomical spot as in one of the volunteers. A possible cause for this pressure point is the increased prominence of the ulnar head during pronation of the wrist (as in typewriting). The same pressure problem on the ulnar head was described by Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients were initially restricted in ADL but independent after 3 and 5&#x02009;weeks. Although functional decline and restrictions in ADL have been reported in older adults with distal radial fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] we found no literature about early ADL restrictions during cast or brace treatment to compare with. The customized brace resulted in acceptable comfort and we encountered no serious complications other than secondary fracture displacement in two patients.</p><p id="Par49">In an earlier preclinical study we replaced the custom made 3D printed brace by a similar &#x0201c;confection brace&#x0201d;. We 3D printed similar braces with three-point fixation in eight different stock sizes, based on the 3D scans and measurements of 50 healthy volunteers. This &#x0201c;confection-brace&#x0201d; failed to produce a comfortable fit in most volunteers (unpublished data).</p><p id="Par50">Two secondary fracture displacements in five patients is comparable with the results of non-operative treatment of DRF in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Prognostic factors for redisplacement after initial closed reduction are greater initial displacement and age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. So it is not unexpected to see a high rate of redisplacement in our target group: the older patient with severely dislocated DRF. A Cochrane review on non-operative interventions found no conclusive evidence for the superiority of any immobilisation method in distal radius fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The Aberdeen Colle&#x02019;s fracture brace is based on three-point fixation and good clinical results has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although insufficient stability was not mentioned as a motivation for abandoning further development, a patent application combining functional bracing with K-wires suggests that stability might have been a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Chen et al. did report no loss of reposition in 10 patients with a DRF treated with a week traditional plaster cast followed by treatment in a 3d printed brace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. We hoped for the same extraordinary result but could not reproduce it. Possibly Chen et al. excluded patients with unstable DRFs.</p><p id="Par51">As we explained in the background section we hoped that a personalized brace would result in less secondary fracture displacement than classic non-operative treatment. This was not confirmed and made us prematurely stop patient inclusion.</p><p id="Par52">The subjective experience in the ex vivo study, volunteer study and clinical study was that the brace showed a good fit with adequate three-point fixation without major pressure problems. In the ex vivo model we confirmed the adequacy of fracture reduction. Nevertheless two secondary fracture displacements were seen in five patients in the clinical study. Our hypothesis about the failure of the brace in preventing secondary fracture displacement is that despite providing a good anatomical fit, it cannot compensate for the dislocation forces caused by the brachioradial and carpal extensor muscles. This would explain the difference between the results of the ex vivo and clinical study and the high rate of secondary displacement of unstable DRF in any non-operative treatment.</p><p id="Par53">The major weakness of this study is the small sample size and the remaining question whether better results could be achieved with an improved brace. Our experience and hypothesis about the failure of the brace is why we decided not to persevere in this work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">Possible wrist circumference difference and posttraumatic swelling must be adapted for and most swelling subsides during the first week.</p><p id="Par55">The custom-made 3D printed brace effectively preserves reduction of a dislocated DRF in the ex vivo model.</p><p id="Par56">Healthy volunteers experienced good comfort, minimal pain and no restrictions in ADL while wearing the brace.</p><p id="Par57">Treatment of a dislocated DRF in the acute setting (day one) with a custom-made 3D printed brace, anatomically modelled from a 3D scan of the contralateral wrist is possible.</p><p id="Par58">The custom-made brace failed to prevent secondary fracture displacement in two of the five patients.
