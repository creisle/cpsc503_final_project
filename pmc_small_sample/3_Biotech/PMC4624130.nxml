Bacterial <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase are of two types: type 1 and type 2; type 2 showed antitumor activity because of which interest in <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase arose (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1989</xref>). Normal cells can synthesize <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase and because of their ability to produce this amino acid, normal cells are protected from <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase starvation unlike tumor cells which are dependent on an exogenous supply (Oza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). Depletion of the circulating <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase by <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase enzyme results in anti-neoplastic activity. However, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Erwinia</italic> sp. enzymes have been frequently used in cancer therapy (Avramis and Panosyan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>).</p><p><sc>l</sc>-Asparaginase from bacterial origin can cause hypersensitivity in the long term used, leading to allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. The toxicity is partially attributable to the glutaminase activity of these enzymes (Oza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). <sc>l</sc>-Asparaginases with high asparaginase activity and negligible glutaminase activity are reported to be less troublesome during the course of antitumor therapy (Hawkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>). The search for other asparaginase sources, with new immunological characteristics can lead to enzyme with less adverse effects. Furthermore, new studies have revealed potential application of this enzyme in prevention of acrylamide formation in fried potatoes and similar food products. Therefore, introduction of new fermentation and purification protocols for production of <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase II will be mandatory to satisfy these demands (Aghaeepoor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>). So, in this study we will be describing the cloning, expression, purification and characterization of recombinant <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase from <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials</title><p><sc>l</sc>-Asparaginase-specific primers used in this study were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich Co (India).

Recombinant <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase was developed by cloning <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase from <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> NCYC 1526 (Er A) and expressing in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The enzyme was purified by anion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on immobilized asparagine (Kotzia and Labrou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>). Recombinant <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase has been produced by the use of molecular cloning and genetic engineering techniques. <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants resistant to substrate <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase were studied by Spring et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1986</xref>). It was found that the genes encoding <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase-I and <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase-II were not sequence related.</p><p>Cloning of <italic>E. coli</italic> gene ansB encoding <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase-II, using strategy based on PCR, and sequencing the gene was discussed by Bonthron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1990</xref>). The amino acid sequence differed from 11 positions from the data previously derived by direct amino acid sequencing. Expression of <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase-II encoded by ansB in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> was found to be positively regulated by a cAMP receptor protein (cRP) and anaerobiosis (Jennings and Beacham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1993</xref>). Abundance of AS mRNA was measured by RQ-PCR as reported by Irino et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>), the AS mRNA level paralleled the AS enzyme activity and the AS protein level. Cellular levels of AS synchronized with cellular resistance to <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase in cell lines. Recombinant <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase from <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic>, and purified by 1-step chromatography, was described by Krasotkina et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>). The kinetic properties showed that recombinant <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase combined the main advantages of <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic><sc>l</sc>-asparaginase-II. <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase from <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic> 3937 (Erl-ASNase) has been expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Kotzia and Labrou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>). The enzyme was found to be a tetramer with molecular weight of approximately 141&#x000a0;kDa. It had a pH optima at 6.3 and temperature optima of 34&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 109.99&#x000a0;mM and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of 2.88&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M/min. Its activation energies were found to be dependent on the substrate. The <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase-II functional form exists as tetramer in <italic>Pseudomonas geniculate</italic> (Kitto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1979</xref>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (Khushoo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>) with molecular mass range from 140 to 160&#x000a0;kDa (Aghaiypour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>, El-Naggar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>). The <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase gene of <italic>E. coli</italic> alpha-acetyl actate decarboxylate gene (ALDC) of <italic>B. brevis</italic> were amplified by PCR and cloned into a new vector transformed into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Most of the enzyme activities were secreted into the medium and the new vectors had excellent segregation stability (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>). The enzymatic and structural properties of the recombinant enzyme were investigated and the kinetic parameters [<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub>] for a number of substrates were determined. The enzyme was later immobilized on epoxy-activated Sepharose CL-6B as described by Gladilina et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>) who have taken SP-Sepharose (2.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;cm) equilibrated with 20&#x000a0;mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8. The immobilized enzyme retained most of its activity (60&#x000a0;%) and showed high stability at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. <sc>l</sc>-Asparaginase II gene isolated from thermotolerant <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, cloned in pET20b vector with 6His residues at a c-terminus downstream to the T7 promoter and pelB leader sequence, and biochemically characterized. Apart from clinical use, this enzyme can be used in fried starchy food preparation to reduce the acrylamide content, a potent carcinogen formed during the baking process by the reaction of asparaginase and sugar at hight temperature (Muharram et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>). Application of microbial Lasparaginase in reducing acrylamide formation during the bread-making process, without affecting its physico-sensory properties and play an important role in reducing the formation of acrylamide. Reduction of toxic metabolites like acrylamide and HMF, i.e., Hydroxymethylfurfural (another toxic Maillard reaction compound) formed during baking, was also reduced by <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase treatment. The enzyme-treated bread was same as control bread with respect to organoleptic properties. This opens avenues for the application of microbial enzymes in obtaining safe foods (Mohan Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>).</p><p>Cloning of <italic>E. coli</italic> gene ansB encoding <sc>l</sc>-asparaginase-II, using strategy based on PCR, and sequencing the gene was discussed by (Bonthron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1990</xref>).

Cloned Asparaginase was better in terms of activity and stability at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. This enzyme could be used/stored for longer time periods at room temperature for experiments relating to acrylamide reduction in food products. Also, its higher half-life at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C makes it a more suitable enzyme to be used against cancerous cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors like to acknowledge the Head of
