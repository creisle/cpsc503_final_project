The pathogen enters the plant through the hydathodes and spreads in the vasculature of the leaf and stem. The typical symptom of black rot is the occurrence of V-shaped chlorotic lesions with vertices towards the mid rib of the leaves.</p><p>The development and use of black rot-resistant cultivars have long been recognized as important methods of controlling the disease. The inheritance of major gene resistance has been studied in the diploid <italic>B. rapa</italic> (A genome) and in the tetraploids <italic>B. carinata</italic> (BC genome) and <italic>B. napus</italic> (AC genome) (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1991</xref>; Ignatov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2000</xref>). A single dominant race-specific gene has been mapped to the A genome in <italic>B. napus</italic> (Vicente et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2002</xref>), and QTLs that control resistance to at least two of the most prevalent races of <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> have been mapped in a Chinese cabbage accession of <italic>B. rapa</italic> (Soengas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>).</p><p>Durable resistance to black rot can be imparted by the genes present in the A and B genomes of <italic>Brassica.</italic> To achieve this aim, genes from the wild relative <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> could potentially be easier and quicker to characterize molecularly, and either be used directly in transgenic brassica crops, or facilitate the identification and interspecific transfer of homologous black rot resistance genes from A or B genome sources into vegetable crops. Interestingly, most <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions are resistant to one or more races of <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic>, and more than half exhibit broad-spectrum resistance to all major races of the pathogen suggesting that this wild relative of brassica crops could indeed provide useful sources of durable black rot resistance (Holub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> provided one of the earliest experimental models for the investigation of the interactions of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> with a major crop pathogen, the molecular basis of natural variation in black rot resistance is largely unexplored in this pathosystem (Simpson and Johnson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1990</xref>).</p><p>Defense-related enzymes have a broad action spectrum activity and play key roles in plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions. Peroxidase is one of the most important factors of the plant&#x02019;s biochemical defense against pathogenic microorganisms, and is actively involved in the self-regulation of plant metabolism after infection. Peroxidase activity has been associated with pathogenesis, which in turn leads to reinforcement of cell walls with phenolic compounds. Progress in identifying defense mechanisms in cabbage has been very slow, and few defense-related genes in cabbage have been characterized. Functional genomics and proteomics studies in both resistant and susceptible host plants inoculated with <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> will provide key information on the interaction between the bacteria and the host. The control of black rot is still a worldwide threat and development of black rot-resistant cultivars is very essential as only few black rot-resistant cultivars are known worldwide (Vicente and Holoub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>).</p><p>Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) is a PCR-based method used to generate unbiased cDNAs library and amplifies only differentially expressed cDNAs. The target cDNA library called as the tester population is denatured, and hybridized to the driver cDNAs population present in the excess. Common fragments to both anneal to each other, whereas tester-specific products remain single stranded represent the differentially expressed genes. SSH is used to generate expressed sequence tags (EST).</p><p>The present study involves isolation of genes involved in the resistance to the black rot pathogen in cabbage. The suppression subtractive hybridization method (Diatchenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1996</xref>) was used to generate cDNA libraries enriched in sequences expressed in cabbage leaves during the early stages of hypersensitive response (HR). Several studies indicated that a large number of plant genes are transcriptionally regulated upon challenge by a pathogen, but that most of them may be common to both compatible and incompatible interactions (Maleck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2000</xref>). For focusing on genes strictly involved in the hypersensitive response, cDNA from resistant cabbage cv. <italic>Pusa mukta</italic> plants infected with <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> (incompatible interaction) were subtracted with <italic>Pusa mukta</italic> (uninfected). Here we present a catalogue of cabbage non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and we describe the identification of genes for which expression is regulated during the early events of <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> infection process. These defense genes provide an important genomic resource for understanding the interactions between cabbage and black rot pathogen. The resistance mechanism of a cabbage cultivar has been assessed for the first time in India at the molecular level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Screening of cabbage seed samples for the black rot incidence under green house conditions</title><p>Seeds of different cabbage cultivars were procured from local traders in Mysore and the cvs. <italic>Pusa mukta</italic> and <italic>Golden acre</italic> from Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, India.

The transcriptional diversity in <italic>B. oleracea</italic> var. <italic>capitata</italic>&#x02013;<italic>X</italic>. <italic>campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> interaction in resistant cultivar <italic>Pusa mukta</italic> was studied. 150 unigenes were obtained from the 500 randomly picked positive clones. Upon functional annotation of the 150 unigenes, the ESTs with known biological function accounted for 80&#x000a0;% of total genes. The main aim of the study was to focus on the genes involved in resistance mechanism against <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> in resistant cultivar <italic>Pusa mukta</italic>. <italic>Pusa mukta</italic> is a resistant cultivar obtained from a cross between EC 24855&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;EC 10109 by pedigree selection. It is one of the popular resistant cultivar in northern part of India, but its performance depends on the geographic location and its performance in the southern part of India was assessed.</p><p>Some reports of up-regulation of defense genes during several plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions exist in the literature (Fernandez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>), suggesting the role of proteins in plant defense mechanisms. It is also established fact that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the main source of damage to cell under stress conditions. ROS scavengers like superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase are produced in significant quantity to combat the ROS produced during stress. Peroxidase accumulation and lignifications occur predominantly in the hydathodes, and to a greater extent in resistant cabbage varieties than in susceptible ones. Total peroxidase activities in hydathodal fluids were noted between resistant and susceptible cabbage varieties during pathogenesis.</p><p>The accumulation of peroxidases in the hydathodal fluids of cabbage varieties correlates positively with the level of varietal resistance to black rot. Accumulations of peroxidase in hydathodal fluids are also positively correlated with the occurrence of lignification in the hydathodal region. These results suggest that peroxidases have a dual role in black rot resistance: direct antagonism of <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> at the site of infection, as well as indirect suppression of pathogen spread via peroxidase-mediated increases in lignifications (Gay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2000</xref>). The roles of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-protective genes (katA, katG, and ahpC) and a peroxide sensor/transcription regulator (oxyR) in the viability of <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv<italic>. campestris</italic> at an elevated temperature were evaluated when exposed to multiple stresses in the environment and during interaction with a host plant with <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> (Sarinya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>). The study highlights the role of catalase in <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris.</italic></p><p>The NDR1 (non-race-specific disease resistance) protein is a key component of the signaling pathway of many NBS-LRR resistance proteins. In the <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>&#x02013;<italic>A. thaliana</italic> interaction, NDR 1 expression is induced in response to pathogen challenge. WRKY&#x02014;a transcription factor was putatively encoded. The promoter element (W-box) that binds WRKY proteins has been found in several <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes, which exhibited common regulation patterns under different systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-inducing or -repressing conditions (Maleck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2000</xref>; Fernandez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>).</p><p>HSP70 is one of the major classes of chaperone molecules and also functions in the response to pathogen attack. Therefore, HSP70 is an essential component of the hypersensitive response defense mechanism in plants. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are important intracellular mediators of the information in early defense signaling through protein phosphorylation of downstream signaling components and targets several transcription factors. Moreover, our results indicated that there was a negative relationship between catalase and peroxidase activity with SOD activity. We have identified 150 unigenes from cabbage by cDNA-SSH, representing 10&#x000a0;% of which are novel genes. The presence of cDNAs with non-significant matches are due to the high cut-off value which was set to increase the level of significance of matches with sequences in the databases or that these proteins/genes have not been functionally characterized yet in any plant species. Excessive ROS causes oxidative damage to the plant cell structures, nucleic acids, lipids and proteins under various biotic stress conditions. Hence the up-regulation of ROS-scavenging enzymes related transcripts such as SOD, POD and CAT transcripts in our library suggests that it protects the cell membrane. These results are in conjuncture with our biochemical findings in which a notable increase in these scavengers were observed in pathogen infected plants. Our aim was to find out differentially expressed genes in the resistant cultivar cDNA-SSH study. The EST data reported herein complement in detail to our previous studies of various <italic>Brassica</italic> sp studied. In conclusion, we have identified resistant candidate cDNAs from cabbage and 10&#x000a0;% of which were unclassified s being novel. We found a positive correlation in physio-biochemical and gene expression mechanisms in plant. The study has provided insights into the nature of pathogen-responsive genes in cabbage. The ESTs reported in the study can be used as candidate genes for developing molecular markers to assist breeding of black rot-resistant cabbage varieties. Defense-related genes have proven useful in cereals aimed at improving plants for increased disease resistance.</p><p>Research into <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> and closely related pathovars has now reached the genomic age, although it still lags behind the progress made from the investigation of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> pathogens such as <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic>. A number of disease resistance genes in Brassicas and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> have been postulated some have been mapped but none have been cloned. The effort to identify more disease resistance genes should be continued and some of the most important crops could be improved within the incorporation of disease resistance genes.</p><p>Efficient application of functional genomics tools for disease resistance can help us understand the plant defense signaling and could also reveal novel insights on the interactions between these signaling pathways (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2002</xref>). Furthermore, there is still an inadequacy of a reference set to be used as model for resistance genes that usually cluster in the genomic region. Our study has provided an insight into the host&#x02013;pathogen interactions involved in resistant cabbage cultivar <italic>Pusa mukta</italic>&#x02013;<italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> first of its kind in the area of vegetable research. The study has also highlighted the prominent role of superoxide dismutase and catalase unigenes apart from peroxidase. The superoxide dismutase and catalase can be further utilized for marker-assisted breeding of cabbage cultivars resistant to the black rot pathogen.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>RKR acknowledges the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India, for financial support in the form of a Senior Research Fellowship.
