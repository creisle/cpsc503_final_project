At higher concentration, the degradation rate of freely suspended cells decreased; whereas the same immobilized cells on polyurethane foam completely degraded 0.2&#x000a0;% pendimethalin within 96&#x000a0;h. The repeated batch degradation with the polyurethane foam-immobilized cells was reused for 35 cycles without losing the 0.1&#x000a0;% pendimethalin degrading ability. In contrast, agar-, alginate- and polyacrylamide-immobilized cells could be reused for 15, 18, and 25 cycles, respectively. When the pendimethalin concentration was increased to 0.2&#x000a0;%, the immobilized cells could be reused but the pendimethalin degradation rate was decreased. Polyurethane foam-immobilized cells exhibited better tolerance to pH and temperature alterations than freely suspended cells and could be stored for more than 3&#x000a0;months without losing pendimethalin degrading ability.

Free suspended or immobilized microbial cells can be used for this purpose. However, the immobilized microbial cells have many advantages over free suspended cells under different conditions. For instance, the immobilization of whole cells increases degradation rate owing to increased cell population density, cell wall permeability, and extracellular microbial enzymes stability are improved, cells can be easily removed from the reaction mixture, higher operational stability and storage stability, reuse of immobilized cells in continuous reactors, and allows the bioreactors to operate at flow rates different from the growth rate of the microorganisms (Bettmann and Rehm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1984</xref>; Hall and Rao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1989</xref>; Cassidy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1996</xref>; Ha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>; Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>). In addition, the immobilized cell systems act as a protective cover in the presence of toxic compounds and are more resistant to pH or temperature changes. However, free suspended cells have better mass transfer aspects compared to immobilized bacterial or fungal cells (Trevors et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1992</xref>; Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>).</p><p>In the last two decades, there have been intensive researches on the use of immobilized microbial cells as biocatalysts, using numerous reactors like fed batch, semi-continuous fed batch, and continuous packed bed reactor. Each reactor type possesses its disadvantages and advantages, and the choice of a particular type of a reactor may depend on the operational conditions, and inexpensive and non-toxic support inert material for microbial cell immobilization, etc., (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>). Bacterial cells immobilized on various matrices have been used extensively for biodegradation of various toxic nitroaromatics such as trinitrotoluene (TNT) (Rho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2001</xref>; Ullah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>), nitrobenzene (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Qi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>), 2-nitrotoluene (Mulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>), and 3-nitrobenzoate (Mulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>).</p><p>Pendimethalin [<italic>N</italic>-(1-ethyl propyl) 2,6-dinitro-3,4-xylidine], a common water and soil contaminant, herbicide of dinitroaniline group, is used to control weeds in various crop plants. The use of pendimethalin may adversely affect endangered species of terrestrial and semi-aquatic plants and invertebrates (Kole et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>). One of the best strategies to degrade the hazardous compounds (including pendimethalin) is to use microorganisms. There are few reports on the degradation of pendimethalin by free cells of <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and <italic>Paecilomyces variotii</italic> (Singh and Kulshrestha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1991</xref>), <italic>Azotobacter chroococcum</italic> (Kole et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>), <italic>Bacillus circulans</italic> (Megadi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>), and fungus <italic>Lecanicillium saksenae</italic> (Pinto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). However, there is no report on the degradation of pendimethalin by immobilized bacterial or fungal cells. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to compare the pendimethalin degradation by freely suspended and immobilized cells of <italic>Bacillus lehensis</italic> XJU on various matrices in batch and semi-continuous degradation, and to evaluate the effect of pH, temperature, and storage stability of pendimethalin degradation rate by polyurethane foam (PUF)-immobilized bacterial cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Pendimethalin was a generous gift from Rallis Agrochemicals India Ltd. (Mumbai, India). The 6-aminopendimethalin and 3,4-dimethyl 2,6-dinitroaniline standards were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, USA). Polyurethane foam and nylon meshes were purchased from Merck Specialities Private Limited (Mumbai, India). Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, ammonium persulfate, sodium alginate (SA), nutrient agar, agar&#x02013;agar, sodium chloride, and calcium chloride were purchased from HiMedia Laboratories (Mumbai, India). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and available commercially.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Isolation and identification of the bacterium</title><p>The bacterium was isolated from the contaminated soil samples by enrichment cultures with pendimethalin as a sole carbon source. It was identified based on morphological and biochemical aspects, as well as based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. It was maintained on mineral salt (Seubert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1960</xref>) agar slants containing 0.1&#x000a0;% (w/v) pendimethalin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Isolation and identification of the metabolites of pendimethalin degradation by the isolate</title><p>The mineral salt medium (Seubert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1960</xref>) containing 0.1&#x000a0;% (w/v) pendimethalin was used as the production medium. The inoculated flasks were incubated on an orbital incubator (Model S150, Stuart, India) regulated at 150&#x000a0;rev/min for 24&#x000a0;h at room temperature (30&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). The bacterial growth was turbidometrically followed at 660&#x000a0;nm. The culture filtrate was collected by centrifugation, and ethyl acetate was used to extract the end products of pendimethalin degradation from the culture supernatant. The methanol was utilized to dissolve the residue from extraction. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel G plates was used to analyze the residue for the presence of metabolites, using various solvent mixtures. An aqueous solution of FeCl<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> was used to visualize the metabolites after exposure to I<sub>2</sub> vapors. The metabolites were also quantified by reversed-phase HPLC with a 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5; spherisorb ODS (C<sub>18</sub>) column (250&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;4.6&#x000a0;mm). The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and 50&#x000a0;mM phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 in the (70: 30, v/v) ratio. The flow rate was 1&#x000a0;mL/min, and the peaks were detected at 254&#x000a0;nm. UV&#x02013;visible spectrophotometer was used to record the metabolites absorbance spectra. The metabolites were also further subjected to mass spectral studies (JEOL DX303).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Media used for the degradation studies</title><p>Two different media were used for this study.

The medium was filtered and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. The medium was then dispersed in 100&#x000a0;mL quantities in 500&#x000a0;mL Erlenmeyer flasks and sterilized by autoclaving for 15&#x000a0;min at 15&#x000a0;psi. After sterilization by membrane filtration, pendimethalin was supplemented to the cultivation medium before bacterial inoculation.

Similarly, the biodegradation of the herbicide pendimethalin by <italic>B. circulans</italic>, resulted in the formation of two metabolites, viz., 6-aminopendimethalin by pendimethalin reduction, and 3,4-dimethyl 2,6-dinitroaniline by pendimethalin oxidative dealkylation (Megadi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). Biodegradation of pendimethalin by freely suspended cells of <italic>B. lehensis</italic> XJU and by cells immobilized in agar, SA, PUF, and polyacrylamide was compared with respect to their degradation rate and tolerance against increasing concentrations of pendimethalin. In batch cultures, the freely suspended cells degraded pendimethalin comparatively well at lower concentrations (0.1&#x000a0;%) and degradation rate decreased at higher concentrations. The cells immobilized in SA, PUF, agar, and polyacrylamide matrices were able to survive and degrade pendimethalin at higher concentrations. The cells immobilized in PUF degraded pendimethalin up to the concentration of 0.7&#x000a0;% (w/v) in batch cultures. The present results revealed that the toxicity of pendimethalin at high concentration level could inhibit the metabolism resulting in lower removal efficiency by the free cells. In addition, it indicates that in an immobilized cell culture, the carrier material act as a protective cover against the toxicity of pendimethalin. The enhanced pendimethalin degradation rate can also be ascribed to higher cell population density and higher activity of the cells immobilized in or on these carrier inert materials. Similarly, the inert materials served as a protective cover towards 2-nitrotoluene (Mulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>) and 3-nitrobenzoate (Mulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). Likewise, the higher degradation rates of various toxic nitroaromatics were attributed to higher cell density in the matrices (Cassidy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1996</xref>; Qi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). Increased concentration of pendimethalin was better tolerated and degraded by PUF-immobilized cells than <italic>B. lehensis</italic> XJU cells immobilized in agar, SA, and polyacrylamide, as well as free cells. The cells of Micrococcus <italic>luteus</italic> Z3 immobilized in PUF had the higher nitrobenzene degradation capacity compared to free suspended cells (Qi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). The moderate degradation rate observed with bacterial cells immobilized in agar, alginate, and polyacrylamide can be attributed to the leakage that may result from the mechanical instability and monomer and/or radical toxicity (Hall and Rao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1989</xref>; Trevors et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1992</xref>).</p><p>The semi-continuous degradation data showed that polyacrylamide and PUF-immobilized cells retained the pendimethalin degrading ability for a longer period since they could be reused for 26 and 35 cycles, respectively. But when the concentration of pendimethalin increased, polyurethane foam (PUF)-immobilized cells degraded pendimethalin faster than polyacrylamide-immobilized cells, which suggest that the PUF immobilization is a better technique for the degradation of toxic herbicides in the environment. However, the bacterial cells immobilized in SA and agar exhibited lower degradation ability of pendimethalin with increased cycle numbers. This was ascribed to the mechanical instability and gradual cell leakage from the inert porous beads (Trevors et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1992</xref>; Ha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). Similarly, polyurethane foam was also an excellent support for the degradation of numerous nitroaromatics by bacterial cells (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Mulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>). The increased degradation rate was ascribed to adsorbing capacity, stability, mechanical strength, and high porosity for the PUF-immobilized cells (Roma&#x00161;kevic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>).</p><p>The immobilized cells on PUF exhibited an excellent resistance to pH and temperature alterations, and had the better storage stability of more than 3&#x000a0;months than freely suspended cells in degrading pendimethalin. Similarly, the free and PUF-immobilized <italic>Micrococcus</italic> cells were active in the pH 7.0&#x02013;8.0 at 30&#x02013;35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 5.0&#x02013;10.0 at 25&#x02013;40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, respectively, in degrading 2-nitrotoluene (Mulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>). Likewise, a narrow range of pH (6.5&#x02013;7.5) and temperature (30&#x02013;35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), and a broad range of pH (5.0 to 10.0) and temperature (20&#x02013;40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) were observed for freely suspended and PUF-immobilized cells, respectively, in degrading 3-nitrobenzoate (Mulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). The immobilized cells could be stored more than 3&#x000a0;months without losing too much pendimethalin degradation capacity. Similarly, the PUF-immobilized cells of <italic>Bacillus flexus</italic> strain XJU-4 and <italic>Micrococcus</italic> sp. strain SMN-1 were stored for 60 and 70&#x000a0;days at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C without losing the capacity to degrade 3-nitrobenzoate (Mulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>) and 2-nitrotoluene (Mulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>), respectively. An effective biodegradation of elevated concentration of dinitroaniline herbicides (such as pendimethalin) and various nitroaromatic compounds can be achieved using immobilized microbial technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present investigation has revealed the biodegradation of pendimethalin by the bacterial isolate <italic>B. lehensis</italic> XJU. It also showed the pendimethalin biodegradation by freely suspended and immobilized <italic>B. lehensis</italic> XJU on different matrices. The microorganisms capable of degrading toxic compounds can therefore be immobilized by entrapment in an inexpensive supports and the immobilized cells retain their ability over a considerable period of time, especially for PUF. Thus, the immobilized microbial cell systems may find applications in the treatment of various contaminated environment sites. However, prior to large-scale application of such systems, further studies are needed for determining the optimal operating conditions.
