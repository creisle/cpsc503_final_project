In addition to PAMPs, PRRs recognize endogenous molecules released from damaged tissue or dead cells [damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)] and activate signaling cascades to induce inflammatory processes. In the aquatic environment, large variation in seasonal and diurnal water temperature causes heat and cold stresses in fish, resulting in tissue injury and mortality of fish. In the Indian subcontinent, catla (<italic>Catla catla</italic>) is an economically important freshwater fish species and is prone to thermal stresses. To investigate the response of pattern recognition receptors in thermal stress, we analyzed TLRs (TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5) and NOD (NOD1 and NOD2) receptors gene expression in catla following heat and cold stress. Analysis of tissue samples (gill, liver, kidney and blood) of the thermal stressed and control fish by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) induction of TLR2, TLR4 and NOD2 gene expression in majority of the tested tissues of the treated fish as compared to the control. The expression of TLR5 and NOD1 gene was also induced in the heat and cold stressed fish, but mostly restricted in the blood. The downstream signaling molecule of TLR and NOD signaling pathway viz., MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) and RICK (receptor interacting serine-threonine protein kinase-2) was also induced in the thermal stressed fish suggesting the engagement of TLR and NOD signaling pathway during thermal stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Catla catla</italic></kwd><kwd>Water temperature</kwd><kwd>Thermal stress</kwd><kwd>TLR</kwd><kwd>NOD</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The success of aquaculture depends on providing an optimum and congenial environment to fish which subsequently helps to achieve their higher survival rate and growth (Boyd and Tucker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1998</xref>). The health status of aquatic animals is uniquely influenced by their immediate surroundings viz., pH, salinity, temperature, ambient light intensity, presence of contaminants, dissolved oxygen concentration etc. (Tort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). Among these, temperature is one the most important abiotic factors that plays a critical role in the life of poikilothermic animals like fish (Fry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1971</xref>; Brett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1971</xref>; Stewart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>). Various fish species differ in requirement of their optimal temperature (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>). Beyond that limit, fishes experience the thermal stress resulting in tissue injury and are prone to be infected by opportunistic pathogens (Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>; Gordon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2005</xref>; Dalvi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>). To defend against pathogenic invasion, fish primarily depend upon non-specific or innate immunity contributed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors. In addition to the PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) recognition, TLRs sense DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) which are endogenous host molecules viz., fibronectin (Okamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2001</xref>), heparin sulfate (Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>), biglycan (Schaefer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>), fibrinogen (Smiley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>), oligosaccharides of hyaluronan breakdown products (Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>; Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2007</xref>), heat shock proteins (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>), high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) (Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2011</xref>), tenascin-C (Midwood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>), cardiac myosin (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2009</xref>), S100 proteins, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>) etc. Physiologically, these endogenous ligands are localized under different cellular compartment, but under stress they are either released passively from the injured tissues/dying cells or actively secreted by activated cells via non-conventional lysosomal route (Pollanen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>). Endogenous TLR ligands act as alarmins and may serve as early warning signals to innate and adaptive immunity (Matzinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>; Seong and Matzinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2004</xref>). Recognition of DAMPs by PRRs activates signaling cascade resulting in the induction of cytokines, recruitment of more immune cells and repair of damaged tissue (Medzhitov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>). In addition to TLRs, NOD-like receptors (NLRs) have also been shown to respond to both microbial components (Franchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>) and endogenous ligands derived from tissue/cellular injuries (Ting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>; Tschopp and Schroder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>; Krishnaswamy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>; Monie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>).</p><p>The global climate is rapidly changing, resulting in significant shift in water temperatures and stresses in various fish species (Jain and Kumar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>). The variation in water temperature has been shown to modulate the expression of TLR gene transcripts in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) (Sundaram et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>). In India, among various freshwater fish species, catla (<italic>Catla catla</italic>) is one of the most commercially important and highly favored fish in the farming industry. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate the response of TLRs and NOD receptors in catla during thermal stresses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fish</title><p>Catla fry (0.676&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.026&#x000a0;g) was obtained from a local fish farm and was stocked in 50 L glass aquaria in the wet laboratory. Before the start of the experiment, acclimatization was carried out for 3-weeks at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to avoid the handling stress. The fish was fed twice a day with laboratory prepared feed (40&#x000a0;% protein) at the rate of 5&#x000a0;% of their body weight.

In this way, the treated aquaria attained 20 and 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C after 2.5&#x000a0;days, and 10&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C after 7.5&#x000a0;days.</p><p>For sampling, fish were collected from each tank (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) after 12&#x000a0;h of achieving the assigned temperature to study the immediate effect of stress after exposure. Then again fish were collected after 7&#x000a0;days to study the effect of chronic stress. Total two samplings were conducted in all treatments, except at 10&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C because fish died before second sampling.

For negative control, qRT-PCR reaction without cDNA was considered. To determine PCR efficiencies, qRT-PCR with serial dilutions of cDNA was carried out. The efficiencies were&#x000a0;~100&#x000a0;%, that allowed the use of 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;CT</sup> method to calculate relative gene expression of the target genes with that of reference gene, &#x003b2;-actin.

Similarly, in catla, the activation of TLR2 and TLR4 is likely to be mediated through Hsp during heat stress and HMGB1 released from the necrotic cells (Tsung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2005</xref>). In addition to these, other endogenous TLR ligands released from damaged tissue and cells may activate TLRs. Recognition of endogenous ligands by TLR5 was previously been reported in rheumatoid arthritis (Chamberlain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). In catla, significant induction of TLR5 gene expression in blood suggests tissue injury resulting in the release of endogenous TLR5 ligands. However, further works are necessary to draw any conclusion in this regard.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-1</title><p>We next analyzed NOD1 gene expression in thermal stressed and control fish at 12&#x000a0;h post-exposure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).
