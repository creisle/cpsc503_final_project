On the basis of their mode of action, two types of chitosanase enzymes have been reported: exo-(EC 3.2.1.165) and endochitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132). Endo-acting enzymes hydrolyse &#x003b2;-1,4 linkages between Gln (glucosamine) residues in partly acetylated chitosan. It is used for production of chitooligosaccharides (COS) by acting on reducing end of chitosan; however, exo-enzymes attacks chitosan from non-reducing end of COS or chitosan to produce Gln (glucosamine) or <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine residue (NAG) (Thadathil and Velappan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). Endo- and exochitosanase chitosanases have been reported from a number of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and plants (Somashekar and Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>); however, the study of endochitosanases is more frequent than exo-acting enzymes. Frequent reports of endo-acting chitosanase enzymes can be attributed to the increasing importance of COS in various fields. Importance of study of exochitosanases has been undermined comparatively.</p><p>The end products of exochitosanase hydrolysis are Gln and NAG, which are known for their therapeutic value and used as food supplements. NAG and Gln are used for the treatment of osteoarthritis; however, hydrochloride and sulfate salts of glucosamine are bitter in taste and are avoided. NAG is sweet in taste and is preferred over Gln to be administered orally when used as food supplement, as the therapeutic activity of both the molecule is similar (Kajimoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1998</xref>). NAG and Gln are produced by acid hydrolysis of chitin/chitosan; however, this is not considered to be natural and leads to lot of toxic waste with lower yield (Sakai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>).</p><p>Very few studies on enzymatic production of Gln and NAG have been reported in literature. Exochitosanase enzyme can be used for production of these molecules in an eco-friendly way from various chitosan substrates as they are able to release Gln and NAG from non reducing end of chitosan/chitin molecule.</p><p>A new exochitosanase enzyme was isolated from <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> IIT-004, which also showed transglycosylation activity. Enzyme was immobilized on PANNFM and was used for hydrolysis of chitosan. Isolated enzyme was also purified, characterized, immobilized and was used for chitodimer production using transglycosylation activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>Commercial chitosan from crab shell, average molecular weight 290&#x000a0;kDa, 93&#x000a0;% <italic>N</italic>-deacetylated (DAC); were kind gift from Marine chemicals, Chennai, India. Chitosan from shrimp shell (&#x0003e;75&#x000a0;% deacetylated) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Glucosamine HCl and Chitin were purchased from Hi-media. All other chemicals were procured from SRL, Mumbai, India and were of analytical grade. For isolation and screening, soil was taken from fish market, Chittaranjan Park, New Delhi, India.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Isolation and screening</title><p>Chitosan/colloidal chitosan minimal salt (CMS/CCMS) medium (1&#x000a0;% w/v) was used for isolation and screening of chitosanase producing microbes from soil. Soil samples were weighed, suspended in sterile water and plated after serial dilutions (10<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). Composition of the medium was as follows: 0.5&#x000a0;% (w/v) chitosan, 0.5&#x000a0;% yeast extract, 0.2&#x000a0;% K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1&#x000a0;% KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.07&#x000a0;% MgSO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.05&#x000a0;% NaCl, 0.05&#x000a0;% KCl, 0.01&#x000a0;% CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 2&#x000a0;% Bacto Agar with final pH 6.8. &#x000a0;%. In case of CCMS agar medium 90&#x000a0;ml of colloidal chitosan was added in place of chitosan. The pH was adjusted to 6.0&#x02013;7.0 before autoclaving. Colloidal chitosan was prepared by dissolving 15&#x000a0;g of 90&#x000a0;% deacetylated chitosan in 1&#x000a0;l (Yabuki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1987</xref>).</p><p>Microbial colonies grown on agar plates were point inoculated to CMS broth (100&#x000a0;ml) for screening. Samples were withdrawn at regular interval (24&#x000a0;h) till 1 week and biomass was removed by centrifugation at 4500&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 20&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Chitosanase assay was done by dinitrosalicylic (DNS) acid method in supernatant collected after centrifugation of samples. Microbial isolates showing significant chitosanase enzyme activity (&#x02265;4 U ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were taken for second stage of screening. Selected microbes after first stage of screening were again inoculated in 100&#x000a0;ml of CMS broth and were grown at room temperature on rotary shaker (180&#x000a0;rpm) for 1 week. 1&#x000a0;ml of samples was withdrawn at 16&#x000a0;h time interval and biomass was removed by centrifugation. Exo-/endochitosanase enzyme activity was checked in supernatant by reducing sugar estimation (DNS method) and thin layer chromatography (TLC).</p><p>In the third stage of screening, inducible/constitutive and specific activity of secreted enzyme was checked. Constitutive production was checked by growing isolates in the 100&#x000a0;ml medium containing glucosamine/glucose (1&#x000a0;% w/v) as carbon source and yeast extract (0.2&#x000a0;% w/v) as nitrogen source along with minimal salts (same as in CMS).</p><p>In the fourth stage of screening, the axenic cultures of the selected microorganisms were inoculated in 200&#x000a0;ml of chitosan minimal salt broth medium in 1&#x000a0;l of Erhlenmeyer flask (Borosil, India) and incubated at 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C on orbital shaker at 250&#x000a0;rpm for one week. 5&#x000a0;ml of samples was withdrawn at 8&#x000a0;h interval and cells were harvested by centrifugation (5500&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 20&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) in pre-weighed falcon tubes or filtration in case of mycelia. The supernatant was checked for extracellular chitosanase enzyme activity. Protein estimation was done by Bradford&#x02019;s assay and change in medium pH was also monitored with time. Biomass estimation was done by taking dry cell weight for fungal culture and OD 600&#x000a0;nm was recorded for bacterial culture.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Preparation of chitosan and enzyme assay</title><p>Chitosanase activity was determined by measuring the reducing sugars produced from chitosan. 300&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of the crude enzyme was mixed with 500&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of chitosan (1&#x000a0;% w/v) and 700&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of acetate buffer (200&#x000a0;Mm, 5.5). Reaction mixture was incubated for 30&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Enzyme was deactivated by heating the reaction mixture at 100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;min. The reducing sugars in the supernatant were measured by using modification of Schales (1945) method using glucosamine HCl as the calibration standard.

Biomass was harvested by mycelium filtration and all purification steps were performed at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Chitosanase activity was checked in the supernatant collected after centrifugation. Acetone fractionation was done by adding four times the volume of chilled Acetone to 0.5&#x000a0;l volume of the culture broth at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with continuous stirring. Mixture was left for 4 and 12&#x000a0;h and precipitated protein was recovered after centrifugation at 6000&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 30&#x000a0;min. Pellet was collected and was left for acetone evaporation at room temperature. After complete evaporation of acetone, pellet was suspended in minimum volume of sodium acetate buffer (100&#x000a0;mM, 5.5 pH) till further use at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Chitosanase assay was done by DNS and protein estimation was done by Bradford&#x02019;s method in the suspension and was compared to crude chitosanase enzymes activity in culture broth. Protein was loaded on pre equilibrated DEAE Sepharose column (1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;20 CM, Merck) with acetate buffer. A flow rate of 2&#x000a0;ml&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was maintained and 5&#x000a0;ml fractions were collected. Unbound proteins were washed with buffer and enzyme protein was eluted with 0.1&#x02013;1&#x000a0;M NaCl in Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer (pH 7.0) gradient. Active fractions were loaded on CM-Sepahrose, bound protein from which were eluted by applying linear 1000&#x000a0;ml gradient of 0.1&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;M NaCl in Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer (pH 7.0). Chitosanase enzyme assay was done in each fraction pooled from the columns and was concentrated. Concentrated fractions were loaded onto fast flow Superdex&#x02122; (Pharmacia, FPLC) 200 columns (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;cm) GL and 5&#x000a0;ml of active fraction were collected after maintaining a flow rate of 1.8&#x000a0;ml&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

Release of reducing sugar by incubated PANNFM immobilized enzymes were compared with that of lyophilized enzymes as control. Buffers like glycine&#x02013;HCl (2.2&#x02013;3.6); sodium acetate (3.6&#x02013;5.6); sodium phosphate (5.8&#x02013;8.5) and glycine-NaOH (8.6&#x02013;10.6) buffers were used to check stability and activity of PANFNM-chitosanase at different pH. Enzymes were incubated in the above-mentioned buffers suitable in different pH ranges and residual activity was checked for stability studies. Optimum pH for chitosanase enzymes activity was checked by carrying out the enzymatic reactions in these buffers at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. Reusability were evaluated by washing the membrane with acetate buffer (200&#x000a0;mM, 5.5 pH) after completion of each reaction cycle. Chitosan (1&#x000a0;% w/v), 3&#x000a0;ml was used as substrate for starting each new cycle of reaction and this process was repeated up to ten cycles. Storage stability was checked by storing in acetate buffer at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Activity was checked after every five days and was monitored up to 60&#x000a0;days. TLC and High-performance TLC (HPTLC) were used for qualitative and quantitative estimation of COS. Hydrolysis of chitosan was done by adding 0.5&#x000a0;g of PANNFM-chitosanase to 50&#x000a0;ml of 1&#x000a0;% (w/v) of chitosan in 200&#x000a0;mM acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C temperatures up to 24&#x000a0;h.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>Numerous reports of isolation of endochitosanase secreting microbes from ecological niches are available (Somashekar and Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>; Thadathil and Velappan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>); however comparatively, studies on isolation of exochitosanase secreting microbes are scantily available. More number of microbial colonies on colloidal chitosan medium can be explained by the fact that more acetyl groups are removed while preparing the colloidal form of chitosan which improved solubility. Soil collection from fish waste dumping zone also improved the chances of getting diverse group of microbial population as compared to other samples. It was concluded that soil could be good source of novel microbial species secreting industrial enzymes. Enrichment culture technique could be better than direct isolation.</p><p>Absence of enzyme production in non chitosan medium indicated that isolate was not producing enzyme constitutively but the enzyme production was induced one.</p><p>Optimum temperature of 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C have been reported for <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. strain S65 (Su et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>), <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> CHB101 (Shimosaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1995</xref>), <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> D-11 (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>) and <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> TKU018 (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>). Chitosanase enzyme from <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. 1794 has been reported to be stable up to 80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min (Zitouni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>). <italic>Nocardia</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. have been reported to be stable up to 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (Nanjo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1990</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2000</xref>). Optimum pH of 5.5 has also been recorded for intracellular chitosanase enzyme from <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic> (Struszczyk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>), <italic>Nocardia</italic> (Nanjo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1990</xref>) and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2000</xref>).</p><p>Transglycosylation reaction by enzymes for synthesis of higher oligosaccharides has been studied previously using salts at higher concentration (Usui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1990</xref>) and using a microreactor especially designed for lowering the water content (Hsiao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). These types of reactions can be enhanced by increasing the substrate concentration, lowering the water content and products are precipitated by reversing the hydrolysis reaction. Similar results have been reported for lysozyme in presence of ammonium sulfate (Akiyama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1995</xref>). Change in reaction conditions can lead to unusual catalytic activity, i.e. where hydrolytic enzymes can be used for synthesis of COS by transglycosylation activity.</p><p>Lipase immobilization on PANNFM by amidination reaction has been reported previously (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>) which required only 5&#x000a0;min of surface activation. The difference may be attributed to difference in processing and fabrication of nanofibres. Increases in <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> value indicated low affinity towards substrates which may be attributed to distortion of active sites of enzyme due to covalent attachment or due to reduced access of substrates depending upon mass transfer limitation. Increase in temperature optimum was attributed to restriction of conformational mobility due to covalent bond between matrix and enzyme and as a result higher activation energy, same trend has been observed for immobilized lipase (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>), which could be explained by charge on support material i.e. PANNFM and retention of more than 50&#x000a0;% of its catalytic activity even after 10 batches of uses can be compared to previously reported decrease in enzyme activity after 5 to 6 uses (Kuroiwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>) which was done on nanoparticles.</p><p>Exochitosanases reportedly cut chitosan and COS from non reducing ends and produce glucosamine (Somashekar and Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>). Fermentative production of gln has been reported previously (Sitangagng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>; Jung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). Improper mixing of reaction mixture and mass transfer limitation could be explained as reason behind lower yield of product as compared to free enzymes. Immobilized chitosanase have been reported previously for COS production (Kuroiwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>; Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2014</xref>; Sinha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>) but very few reports regarding production of glucosamine are available (Sinha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>).</p><p>Glucosamine can be produced enzymatically for human consumption and with optimization yield can be enhanced at industrial scale for large scale production. Cost effective production can be achieved using chitosan as substrates due to its wider availability as marine waste. Immobilized enzymes are more effective for production of glucosamine due to their high thermo stability and storage stability.
