They offer a number of advantages over other materials being versatile, light weight, low cost, strong and potentially transparent and are ideally suited for a variety of applications. However, plastic materials have several disadvantages, the most important criterion is its long-term persistence in the environment and their resistance to degradation. A general estimate of worldwide plastic waste generation is about 57 million tons (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>). Polyethylene is the one of the most abundant commercially produced synthetic polymers. LDPE accounts for 60&#x000a0;% of the total plastics production of plastic bags and most commonly found solid waste. Polyethylene is very resistant to biodegradation due to its high hydrophobicity and its long carbon chains (Contat-Rodrigo and Ribes Greus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2002</xref>). Under normal condition, it takes more than 10 decades to mineralize the polymers (Ohtake et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>). Several cities in Brazil have prohibited the distribution of plastic bags by supermarkets and other commercial establishments because they are made of various chemicals which are toxic to the health and the environment. An estimated one million birds and ten thousands marine animals die each year as a result of ingestion of plastics (Palmisano and Pettigrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1992</xref>). Intensive research is being carried by scientist in the development of degradable plastics to enhance biodegradability of plastic products in landfills and composts. Degradable plastic is a plastic designed to undergo significant changes in its chemical structure under specific environmental conditions resulting in loss of some of its properties (Albertsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1987</xref>). Polymeric characteristics such as molecular weight, crystallinity, functional groups, mobility, substituent present in the structure and the additives added to the polymers play a significant role in its degradation (Gu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). The fate of these organic polymers in the environment and the time required for their total mineralization to CO<sub>2</sub> have yet to be fully understood. To relieve the abnormal circulation, there are two ways, one is to develop the latent ability of microorganisms to degrade plastics presently used and the other is to develop synthetic polymers susceptible to degradation (Hiroyuki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1978</xref>). Low-density polyethylene can be degraded in various methods as follows: chemical degradation, photodegradation and biological degradation (Da Luz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). The microbial species associated with the degrading polymers were identified as bacteria (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Micrococcus)</italic>, <italic>fungus (Aspergillus niger</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus glaucus</italic> and <italic>Trichoderma</italic>) (Swift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1997</xref>). There are many researchers around the globe investigating the ability of enzymes released by microbes in oxidizing the hydrocarbon of polymer. Microbial enzymes induce the rate of biodegradation of LDPE very effectively without causing harm to the environment. The extracellular enzymes are too large to penetrate deeply into the polymer material, and so, act only on the polymer surface, consequently the biodegradation of plastics is usually a surface erosion process. The UV irradiation (photo-oxidation) and thermal and chemical oxidation of polyethylene prior to its exposure to a biotic environment enhances biodegradation.</p><p>The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the biodegradation of LDPE films by exposing them to the isolated fungal strain. Fungus was chosen as they are highly diverse and they play a major role in decomposition of lignocellulose polymer and posses wider metabolic capabilities. The morphological changes of LDPE were analyzed after degradation through AFM and SEM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p>The chemicals used in this present study were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Microbes that grow utilizing the polymer lead to an increase in weight due to the adherence of microbes, whereas a loss of polymer integrity leads to weight loss. Weight loss of LDPE is proportional to the surface area since biodegradation usually is initiated at the surface of the polymer. After the degradation period, the LDPE films were treated with SDS as surfactant which denatures the cells and completely wash off from the surface. The reduction in weight was observed after the biodegradation of LDPE. In our study, 35&#x000a0;% weight loss of LDPE films was observed after 90&#x000a0;days of incubation with <italic>A. clavatus</italic> strain JASK1 whereas in control flask there is no weight loss of LDPE films.

LDPE films exposed to <italic>A. clavatus</italic> strain JASK1 showed surface erosion, cracks, folding and fungal colonization (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This may be due to the extracellular metabolites and enzymes released by the fungus in response to stress. Surface bio-erosion is the primary cause of mass loss from surface. As a cross reference to the earlier studies on the biodegradation of LDPE, many researchers have reported the same morphological changes on LDPE degradation by <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (Volke-Sepulveda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>; Limon-Gonzalez and Favela-Torres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>; Sahebnazar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Scanning electron microscopy of <italic>Aspergillus</italic>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The research article deals with efficient degradation of LDPE by the isolate <italic>A. clavatus</italic> for duration of 90&#x000a0;days exposure. To the best of our knowledge, there are no research articles supporting polyethylene degradation by <italic>A. clavatus.</italic>
<italic>A. clavatus</italic> qualifies as a suitable candidate for LDPE degradation. As LDPE accumulation in the environment is a serious threat this isolate will be of major use in degradation. Though there are many works on LDPE degradation there is no detailed explanation on molecular mechanism behind degradation which will help in implementing biodegradation of LDPE.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the Management, VIT University, Vellore, Tamil Nadu for providing the facilities for this work.</p></ack><ref-list
