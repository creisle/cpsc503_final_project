Among these bioreactors, fluidized bed bioreactor (FBR) is one of the best and present many advantages related to hydrodynamics and mass transfer phenomena. Use of fluidization as a contact technique has gained considerable importance in the biochemical field (Sch&#x000fc;gerl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1997</xref>) as FBR gives intimate contact between the liquid and solid phases (Shieh and Keenan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1986</xref>; Worden and Donaldson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1987</xref>). Biological treatment of industrial wastewaters, in general, requires a great deal of space as well as time (retention time can be many days) when using activated sludge or aerated lagoon -based systems (H&#x000fc;ppe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1990</xref>; Shieh and Keenan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1986</xref>; Wu and Wisecarver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1992</xref>). An FBR, on the other hand, is capable of achieving treatment in low retention time because of the high biomass concentration that can be attained in a bioreactor (Shieh and Keenan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1986</xref>; Yoong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>). While similar to a trickling filter (a packed-bed fixed-film bioreactor) in treatment concept, FBR offers distinct mechanical advantages which allow small and high surface area material to be used for biomass growth (Shieh and Keenan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1986</xref>). Fluidization overcomes operating problems, such as bed clogging and high pressure drop, which would occur if small materials with high surface area were employed in packed-bed operation (Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>). Rather than clogging with new biomass growth, the FBR bed simply expands. Thus, for comparable treatment efficiency, the required bioreactor volume is greatly reduced (Shieh and Keenan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1986</xref>). Hirata et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>) and Safferman and Bishop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1996</xref>) reported that FBR has active transfer phenomena accelerated by fluidizing materials, and the reactor retains 5&#x02013;10 times higher biomass concentration than conventional activated sludge reactors. Subsequently, much attention has been directed to FBRs recently&#x02014;over other suspended-growth systems&#x02014;due to high biomass concentrations, low hydraulic residence times, small footprint requirements, and absence of mechanical moving parts (Lohi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>) in FBRs.</p><p>Reports indicate that oil will remain a major source of energy for several decades to come. Thus, the pollution as result of oil spillage during manufacturing and transportation of refinery products poses a major challenge. With respect to continuous microbial treatment of petroleum wastewater containing several toxic organic compounds, Karamanev and Margaritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2005</xref>) reported the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in an immobilized cell airlift bioreactor using soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons as the source of naturally occurring microorganisms. Lohi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>) treated diesel fuel-contaminated wastewater aerobically in a three-phase fluidized bed reactor under the unsteady- and steady-state conditions. Attached biomass, in this regard, has been claimed to be more resistant toward toxicity than freely suspended ones (Pedersen and Arvin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1995</xref>). Immobilized biomass is preferred to free cells in FBRs as it offers several advantages, such as reduced mechanical stress, elimination of secondary clarifier, and ease of sludge disposal (Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>).</p><p>With the aim of microbial treatment of petroleum wastewater, we have recently isolated two strains of <italic>B.</italic>
<italic>cereus</italic> (AKG1 MTCC9817 and AKG2 MTCC9818) which show high phenol-tolerance as well as phenol-degradability (Banerjee and Ghoshal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">b</xref>). Evaluation of the biodegradation performance of these isolated strains in a FBR, in this regard, will enrich our knowledge to assess the feasibility of using AKG1 and AKG2 in practical bioremediation of petroleum wastewater. In the present study, microbial treatment of real petroleum wastewater by the immobilized strains of isolated <italic>B. cereus</italic> AKG1 MTCC9817 and <italic>B. cereus</italic> AKG2 MTCC9818 has been carried out in a recirculated up-flow FBR to accumulate preliminary information about the degradation behavior of the strains in the FBR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Growth of bacteria and immobilization of bacterial cells in alginate beads</title><p>The bacterial strains <italic>B. cereus</italic> AKG1 MTCC9817 and <italic>B. cereus</italic> AKG2 MTCC9818, isolated from wastewater samples as reported previously (Banerjee and Ghoshal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>), were grown and maintained in phenol-containing mineral salt medium (MSM: 4.0&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> sodium nitrate (NaNO<sub>3</sub>), 3.61&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>), 1.75&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), 0.2&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;7H<sub>2</sub>O), 0.05&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;2H<sub>2</sub>O), 1.0&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ferrous sulfate (FeSO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;5H<sub>2</sub>O), 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> copper sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;5H<sub>2</sub>O), 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> sodium molybdate (Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>3</sub>), 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> manganese sulfate (MnSO<sub>4</sub>), and 3&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> Yeast extract).

Initial COD level of the refinery wastewater in the present study, prior to the microbial treatment, was measured to be 5600&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The percentage COD removal from refinery wastewater in the FBR by the <italic>B. cereus</italic> (AKG1 and AKG2) immobilized in Ca-alginate beads is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. From Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, it is evident that the COD removal by the immobilized bacterial strains gradually increased as the microbial treatment progressed. For 50&#x000a0;% COD removal, it took around 53&#x000a0;h. Furthermore, on the completion of the biodegradation experiment (~130&#x000a0;h), COD level of the wastewater was reduced by 97.86&#x000a0;%. After 130&#x000a0;h of microbial treatment, final COD level of the refinery wastewater reached a value of 50&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The results essentially demonstrate that the high level of COD (5600&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in the refinery wastewater was successfully removed by immobilized AKG1 and AKG2 in the FBR.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>The COD level and the corresponding COD removal (%) in the refinery wastewater during the microbial treatment in fluidized bed reactors by Ca-alginate immobilized AKG1 and AKG2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_447_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p>Phenol and other phenol derivatives are the major organic compounds present in refinery wastewater and have a direct relation with COD (1&#x000a0;mg phenol&#x000a0;&#x02261;&#x000a0;2.38&#x000a0;mg COD) (Tyagi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1993</xref>). The initial concentration of phenolic compounds in the petroleum wastewater at the beginning of the microbial treatment was measured to be as high as 2545&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the level of phenolic compounds in the petroleum wastewater and subsequent removal (due to biodegradation) during the microbial treatment in the fluidized bed bioreactor by immobilized bacterial strains. In the FBR, the phenolic compounds were biodegraded almost linearly in the initial period of the microbial treatment up to 70&#x000a0;h (~3&#x000a0;days) resulting in 75.63&#x000a0;% removal of the phenolics present in the refinery wastewater. Subsequently, the rate of phenolics removal decreased, and the phenolic compounds of the wastewater were completely (98.03&#x000a0;%) removed after 130&#x000a0;h (~6&#x000a0;days) of treatment. As evident from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, removal of phenolic compounds (%) by the immobilized systems followed the same trend as that of COD removal (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) demonstrating the relation of phenolic compounds with COD as discussed earlier. It may be mentioned here that the identification of products of phenol biodegradation by immobilized AKG1 and AKG2 is important and warrants future investigation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Concentration of phenolic compounds and the corresponding removal (%) in the refinery wastewater during the microbial treatment in fluidized bed reactors by Ca-alginate immobilized AKG1 and AKG2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_447_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>
</p><p>In conclusion, present investigation on continuous biodegradation of the petroleum refinery wastewater in recirculated FBR by the isolated strains of AKG1 and AKG2 immobilized in Ca-alginate beads demonstrated that the microbial treatment reduced initial COD level and concentration of phenolic compounds by 95&#x000a0;% or more, indicating excellent efficacy of the immobilized AKG1 and AKG2 strains in treating petroleum wastewater in continuous mode of operation. Overall, our study strongly suggests the potential of immobilized AKG1 and AKG2 in the treatment of petroleum wastewater in FBRs and provides preliminary results in this
