A total of 426 mills were in operation in 2011, where production of crude palm oil was 24.97 million tonnes (MPOB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). The earnest revenue collected from the palm oil industry has a huge contribution towards Malaysia&#x02019;s development and improved standard of living. Nevertheless, the extraction of oil from the palm fruit requires large volume of water which subsequently produces wastewater high in COD values in the range of 15,000&#x02013;100,000&#x000a0;mg/l. The palm oil mill industry has also been identified as the largest contributor to the pollution load in rivers in Malaysia, stimulating an intensive search for an alternative method which is environmentally friendly for the degradation of pollutant in POME.</p><p>With increasing government demand for environmental friendly industrial processing systems, the oil palm industry in Malaysia has been facing challenges treating the POME economically, as well as fulfilling the discharge limit stipulated by the government (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>). There have been several reports on biological treatment of POME, such as on raw POME (Vijayaraghavan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>; Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>) and final POME (Neoh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>; Georgiou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, bioremediation of POME from anaerobic pond (AnPOME) has not been previously reported. There are various methods that have been used in the treatment of POME. Liew et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>) reviewed most of the polishing treatment systems for POME and suggested that membrane filtration processes, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) with addition of hydrogen peroxide or Fenton reagent were more effective for the treatment of POME. However, the maintenance cost for MBR bioreactor was expensive due to biofouling as POME contained high concentration of suspended solids (El-Shafey and Al-Hashmi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Neoh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>). On the other hand, AOPs tend to produce highly toxic by-products. Abdullah et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>) developed aerobic granular sludge for treatment of diluted raw POME, and it was efficient in the removal of COD. However, the major drawback of aerobic granulation is a long start-up period of granule formation from the flocs of activated sludge (Joo-Hwa Tay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>).</p><p>Currently, the existing POME treatment mainly involves ponding systems which comprise anaerobic and facultative stages. In Malaysia, over 85&#x000a0;% of the mills have adopted the conventional anaerobic ponding system that was based on suspended growth of activated sludge (Zahrim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>). The anaerobic pond is one of the intermediate ponds with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 30&#x02013;80&#x000a0;days (Igwe and Onyegbado <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>). The anaerobic treatment is also considered as cost effective. However, anaerobic ponding system has several critical drawbacks that should be considered for further improvement, for example, extended period of HRT, solids accumulation, inconsistent nutrient removal, large land area requirement (Shilton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>), and produced noxious odors. During the anaerobic process, a volume of 375,000,000&#x000a0;m<sup>3</sup> methane is evolved from the open ponding systems, equivalent to 8,610,000,000&#x000a0;m<sup>3</sup> of carbon dioxide production, which is 3.6&#x000a0;% of the estimated total emissions of greenhouse gases in Malaysia. POME is also one of the sources contributing to the global environmental issues specifically relating to climate change. Most of the oil palm industries in Malaysia are not equipped with biogas recovery systems due to the high capital and operating costs (Yeoh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>). Hence, the biogas that is released into the atmosphere aggravates the effects of global warming. Since the objective of this study is to shorten the period for POME treatment, this will in turn help reduce emissions of greenhouse gases which will subsequently reduce the risks of global warming. POME contained high concentration of polyphenolic compounds which are carcinogenic, toxic, and creating unpleasant odor in water resources. Phenolic pollution has arisen as a serious problem, and there is a need for removal of phenolic in POME efficiently (Gholizadeh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>).</p><p>The main objective of this study was to treat AnPOME using single culture of bacteria. The bacteria were selected based on the ability to degrade KL. Parameters such as COD, pH, ammoniacal nitrogen, total polyphenolic compounds, lignin, color, heavy metal, and toxicity were also monitored. To the best of our knowledge, research utilizing <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. enzymatic systems for POME degradation has not been reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Culture condition</title><p>The AnPOME obtained from the palm oil industry in Johor was stored in the refrigerator at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

Then, the KL stock solution was added in mineral salts medium that contained 0.1&#x000a0;% w/v KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (QRec), 0.05&#x000a0;% w/v MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05&#x000a0;% w/v NaCl (Merck), 1&#x000a0;% w/v glucose (Merck), and 0.5&#x000a0;% w/v peptone (Merck). Isolated bacteria were selected for growth in 250&#x000a0;ppm KL-mineral salts medium at 150&#x000a0;rpm (Protecth Shaker Incubator Model SI-50D), 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 4&#x000a0;days. Next, bacteria (10&#x000a0;% v/v) were selected based on the lignin reduction. To select the best bacteria for lignin reduction, bacteria were transferred into mineral salt medium supplemented with higher concentration of KL (500&#x000a0;ppm) in 500&#x000a0;ml conical flask. The bacteria that gave the highest reduction of lignin were used for the forthcoming experiments. Data from the selection of bacteria capable to reduce lignin were subject to LSD test (0.05) for the identification of significant differences between bacteria. SPSS statistics 17.0 was used to conduct LSD test and standard error for the data.</p><p>The selected bacteria were further acclimatized by, subsequently, sub-culturing the bacteria into fresh, sterilized medium supplemented with increasing concentration of AnPOME. The acclimatization process was continued until the bacteria were able to grow in 100&#x000a0;% AnPOME. The acclimatized bacteria were further used for treatment of AnPOME at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 150&#x000a0;rpm for 6&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>16SrDNA and phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Chromosomal DNA was isolated using Promega Wizard<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Genomic DNA Purification Kit following the standard method stated.

The color (ADMI unit), COD (reactor digestion method), and ammoniacal nitrogen (Nessler method) were determined by HACH DR 5000 (HACH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>). The pH was measured using Sartorius PB-10 pH meter. Total polyphenolic compounds were quantified with Folin&#x02013;Ciocalteau Reagent using gallic acid as the standard. The lignin content of the samples was estimated using KL as the standard (Neoh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013b</xref>). All experiments were conducted in triplicates.</p><p>Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Perkin Elmer Elan 6100) was applied for determination of the heavy metals in this work. The ICP-MS was operated using argon gas as carrier gas with gas flow of 0.435&#x000a0;l/min. AnPOME before and after treatment were filtered using 0.2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m membrane and acidified to pH 2 with HNO<sub>3</sub> for metal analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the functional groups of the AnPOME</title><p>FTIR spectroscopy (Nicolet iS5) was used to identify the functional groups present in the samples.

Then, 6 bacteria that showed the ability to reduce concentration of KL (250&#x000a0;ppm) within 70&#x02013;84&#x000a0;% were selected. Consequently, the selected bacteria were transferred as individual cultures into higher concentration of KL (500&#x000a0;ppm). However, only three out of six bacteria were tolerant to high level of KL and able to reduce concentration of KL. The strain SZ1 from textile sludge showing highest color removal (81&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;%) showed significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) from the rest of the bacteria, and thus were further selected for acclimatization prior to the treatment of POME. The initial color of KL was 1512&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;45 ADMI at 500&#x000a0;ppm and reduced to 280&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;20 ADMI at the end of 4&#x000a0;days of treatment. No change in color or lignin content was found in the control. The color reduction of KL was probably due to depolymerization of lignin polymers by bacterial ligninolytic systems (Chandra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>) or adsorption process. Even though bacteria able to adsorb colored compounds, adsorption process usually would not contribute to high degree of the decolorization process. Lim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>) investigated the desorption process from decolorization of dye by <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, and found out that desorption of color from bacterial pellet using 0.1&#x000a0;M NaOH produced approximately 11&#x000a0;% of color removal Strain SZ1 showed high efficiency for KL degradation as compared to previous reported studies except for co-culture of bacteria. <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. Raj et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007b</xref>) only showed reduction for 37&#x000a0;% of KL (500&#x000a0;ppm) and <italic>Aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus</italic> (Raj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007a</xref>) showed reduction of 43&#x000a0;% of KL (250&#x000a0;ppm). Another study showed that <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> were able to degrade KL (800&#x000a0;ppm) up to 50 and 45&#x000a0;%, respectively (Yadav and Chandra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>). Co-culture of the two bacteria showed a better performance in degradation of KL up to 58&#x000a0;% after 144&#x000a0;h. Shi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013a</xref>) showed that <italic>Cupriavidus basilensis</italic> B-8 isolated from erosive bamboo slips were able to degrade 31&#x000a0;% KL (2000&#x000a0;ppm) in 7&#x000a0;days. The authors also identified that MnP and laccase demonstrated the greatest enzyme activities at the third and fourth days of treatment. Shi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013b</xref>) stated that <italic>Pandoraea</italic> sp. B-6 were able to degrade KL (38&#x000a0;% removal of COD) without any co-substrate under the high alkaline conditions. Again, MnP and laccase demonstrated the greatest enzyme activities on the third and fifth days for the degradation of KL.</p><p>The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain SZ1 (consisting of 1374 nucleotides) were determined, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on 16S rRNA sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The 16S rRNA sequences of strain SZ1 were the most closely related to that of <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. and <italic>Ochrobactrum intermedium</italic> with a homology of 100&#x000a0;%. Based on the phenotypic analysis and phylogenetic characteristics, the strain could be identified as <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp.

</p><p>To date, several studies have reported that <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> species has the ability to degrade phenol (K&#x00131;l&#x00131;&#x000e7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>), sulphide and nitrile (Mahmood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>), tetrabromobisphenol (An et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>), and N,N-dimethylformamide (Sanjeev Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). This indicated that <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> species have the ability to remediate many pollutants found in the wastewater; however, there are no research and information about the potential application of this bacterial strain for the bioremediation of high-strength agricultural wastewater.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Treatment of anaerobic POME</title><p>Analysis of autoclaved AnPOME showed color of 4747 ADMI, COD of 11707&#x000a0;mg/l, total polyphenolic of 916&#x000a0;mg/l, lignin of 721&#x000a0;mg/l, ammoniacal nitrogen of 256&#x000a0;mg/l, and BOD/COD ratio of 0.22. Samples with BOD/COD ratio less than 0.1 are considered non-biodegradable, while any value more than 0.1 is considered biodegradable (Samudro and Mangkoedihardjo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>). In this study, BOD/COD ratio for AnPOME was 0.22 and indicated that AnPOME is biodegradable. Compared to non-autoclaved wastewater, autoclaved AnPOME showed a reduction of 10&#x000a0;% of COD, but no changes for the lignin and color unit.</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the reduction in effluent quality parameters when AnPOME was treated using <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp.. The relatively high COD values of AnPOME (11,707&#x000a0;mg/l) was mainly due to the high organic load which may be implied to the presence of lignin, polyphenolic compounds, complex organic compounds, cellulose, or hemicelluloses found in POME. Organic compounds in AnPOME were probably used as nutrients by the bacteria, since no nutrients were added before and during the treatment process. The correlation analysis (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) for COD and growth of bacteria is 0.9553, and this suggested that COD removal was directly proportional to the growth of bacteria. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows that at the beginning, there was a significant increase in growth of the culture, reaching a maximum after 5&#x000a0;days of incubation, followed by a slight decline thereafter. At the same time, a significant reduction in COD occurred after 1&#x000a0;day of incubation. It is worth noting that the reduction of COD was maximum during the exponential phase (day 1&#x02013;5) with a reduction rate of 1440&#x000a0;mg/l/day. The reduction rate for COD decreased to 556&#x000a0;mg/l/day during stationary phase suggesting the insufficient nutrient in POME. The overall treatment resulted in a significant reduction of 71&#x000a0;% COD removal.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Reduction in effluent quality parameters using <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Parameter</th><th align="left">Initial</th><th align="left">Final</th><th align="left">Percentage (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">pH</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">5.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.1</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">9.29&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.05</td><td align="left">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">COD</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">11707&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;83</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3400&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;62</td><td align="left">71</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ammoniacal nitrogen</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">256&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;11</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">103&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5</td><td align="left">60</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total polyphenolic compounds</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">916&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;8</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">415&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10</td><td align="left">55</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All the values presented are in mg/l except pH</p><p>Values are mean of three experiments&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard error</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>

</p><p>The AnPOME inoculated with bacteria also exhibited a decrease in ammoniacal nitrogen from 256 to 103&#x000a0;mg/L within 6&#x000a0;days of treatment. The amount of phenolic compound decreased from 916 to 415&#x000a0;mg/l implying that <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. contributed towards phenol oxidation. Another study reported that <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. were able to metabolize phenol through catechol by two pathways; ortho-pathway or meta-pathway (K&#x00131;l&#x00131;&#x000e7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). Besides, pH of wastewater change from acidic pH to alkaline pH (9.29) is in agreement with other studies that phenol degradation was achieved more efficiently at alkaline pH levels. <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> degraded p-nitrophenol at pH 7.5 to 9.5 (Kulkarni and Chaudhari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>), while <italic>Orchrobactrum</italic> sp. degraded p-nitrophenol at pH 10 (Qiu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>).</p><p>The lignin concentration in AnPOME was 721&#x000a0;mg/l, and there was no reduction of lignin concentration after 6&#x000a0;days of treatment. This may imply that lignin was not used as its carbon sources. It is important to note that bacteria that were able to degrade KL did not show the ability to degrade lignin in lignin rich wastewater, such as AnPOME. A study claimed that bacteria which are able to degrade KL could be of interest for the treatment of lignin rich wastewater, such as pulp and paper mill effluent (Raj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007b</xref>). However, results in this study were in contrast to the previous reported study, in which bacteria were able to degrade KL and they were found having no ability to degrade lignin in POME. This may be, because the chemical structure of KL which differs from natural lignin, as it undergoes various reactions, such as aryl&#x02013;alkyl cleavage, strong modification of side chains, and various ill-defined condensation reactions (Chakar and Ragauskas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>). It is well known that microorganisms exist in mixed culture due to presence of a wide range of compounds in nature. Role of co-culture, such as bacteria&#x02013;bacteria (Lemaire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>) or bacteria&#x02013;fungi (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>) for degradation of several recalcitrant environmental pollutants have been reported. Thus, mixed culture of microorganisms may be more effective in degradation of lignin in AnPOME.</p><p>Colorless catechol is believed to be responsible for the formation of red color in POME, as the catechol will be oxidized to reddish brown melanoid pigments, derivatives of benzoquinone (Mary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). This explains why color was found to increase by about 80&#x000a0;% after the treatment, which increased from 4747&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;120 to 8507&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;84 ADMI.</p><p>ICP-MS method is able to identify and quantify metals presence in water at trace levels. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the concentrations of metals in AnPOME used in this study. According to Malaysia Environmental Quality (Industrial Effluent Regulations 2009), arsenic is the only metal in POME that is slightly higher than the standard discharge limit (0.05&#x000a0;mg/l) for Standard A. However, it is still below Standard B (0.1&#x000a0;mg/l). It should be pointed out that effluent that is discharged upstream of water supply intake should meet Standard A and effluent that is discharged downstream has to meet Standard B. Addition of microorganisms to interact with dissolved metals is a way to reduce heavy metals in wastewater. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows that the bacteria were able to reduce the concentration of selenium, aluminum, zinc, and copper from 7 to 84&#x000a0;%. Besides the significant removal of COD, <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. have the potential to resist and/or reduce the heavy metals in the wastewater. Pandey et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>) stated that <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. were resistant to cadmium and have promised bioremediation as well as for plant growth promotion.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Metal content in AnPOME stated in mg/l (Nickel and Mercury were not detected in AnPOME)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Analyte</th><th align="left">Initial concentration</th><th align="left">Removal percentage (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Aluminum</td><td align="left">0.5552</td><td align="left">49</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lead</td><td align="left">0.00004</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cobalt</td><td align="left">0.0033</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Copper</td><td align="left">0.1429</td><td align="left">67</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Zinc</td><td align="left">1.132</td><td align="left">84</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Arsenic</td><td align="left">0.0521</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Selenium</td><td align="left">0.0126</td><td align="left">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cadmium</td><td align="left">0.0001</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Barium</td><td align="left">0.0139</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

Detection of CMCase and xylanase showed the ability of <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. in excretion of extracellular polysaccharide hydrolyzing enzymes. LiP activity was not detected in the strain, and this might explain the failure of removal of lignin in AnPOME. The ligninolytic enzymes of <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. were only partial support for the higher removal of total polyphenolic compounds in AnPOME, as the enzyme activities were not detected in high level. There may be other enzymes related with the removal of total polyphenolic compounds, and the mechanisms of <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. in treatment of AnPOME still needs further study. The detection of lignocellulolytic enzymes indicated that biological treatment of AnPOME using <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. has been the greater interest in valorization of AnPOME instead of disposal of the wastewater. Besides, wastewater valorization is creating awareness among the society due to depletion of natural sources as well as increasing greenhouse gases.

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The aerobic process has been demonstrated to be very suitable for the treatment of AnPOME. The identified <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. were able to treat AnPOME with a high efficiency to reduce COD, ammoniacal nitrogen, and polyphenolic compounds. It is important to note that the bacteria failed to degrade lignin in AnPOME, although it could degrade KL. FTIR analysis revealed the presence of hydroxyl or amine groups, C&#x02013;H sp<sup>3</sup>, amide carbonyl, and nitro groups which could be related to consequent biodegradation of AnPOME. The high reduction of total polyphenolic compounds along with the production of lignocelluloytic enzymes indicates the suitability of <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. in bioremediation and valorization of various high organic strength wastewaters. Future research may include the application of <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. in a non-sterile condition, and co-culture with bacteria or fungus for further improvement of the degradation process. The degradation products of KL and AnPOME should also be analyzed to understand the degradation mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This article is based on the work supported by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, and Ministry of Sciences and Innovation Malaysia (National Science Fellowship).</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdullah</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Ujang</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Yahya</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Aerobic granular sludge formation for high strength agro-based wastewater treatment</article-title><source>Bioresour Technol</source><year>2011</year><volume>102</volume><issue>12</issue><fpage>6778</fpage><lpage>6781</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.biortech.2011.04.009</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21524907</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akar</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name><name><surname>Gorgulu</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaynak</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Anilan</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Akar</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Biosorption of Reactive Blue 49 dye under batch and continuous mode using a mixed biosorbent of macro-fungus <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic> and <italic>Thuja orientalis cones</italic></article-title><source>Chem Eng J</source><year>2009</year><volume>148</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>26</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.cej.2008.07.027</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>An</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Zu</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Mai</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>One-step process for debromination and aerobic mineralization of tetrabromobisphenol-A by a novel <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp.
