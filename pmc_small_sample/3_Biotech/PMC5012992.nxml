Results from our previous study showed an alteration of various metabolomic parameters, indirectly resulting in an observable decline of growth in the mung seedlings upon incubation with phenol, toluene, xylene, and hexane. This study evaluates the role of these compounds upon plant growth and focusses to mitigate the effect of the same, using some isolated plant synergistic bacteria. We isolated <italic>Proteus</italic> sp., <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp., and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> sp., and tested the synergism of them in mung seedlings (<italic>Vigna radiata</italic>) by hydroponics. Treatment with the above-mentioned compounds significantly reduced the root and shoot length of the seedlings when compared to the control. The bacterial treatment helped in reducing the adversity due to the xenobiotic insult, by improving the root shoot length of the treated seedlings. <italic>Proteus</italic> sp. was found to be the most promising among other isolates. In another experiment, plasmid profiling of the bacterial isolates was done, yielding a band of 4.5&#x000a0;kb common for all, serving as a clue to be the most probable plasmid responsible for the degradation of the compounds.

There are various factors that determine the type of agriculture being done, soil profile being the most important one. Over the years, shifting toward the use of chemical pesticides not only affected the food chain but also upon the soil quality, such as reduced nutrients, water retention capacity. However, certain types of man-made disasters such as petroleum oil spillage create havoc and disrupt the entire agricultural belt along that area. Oil spillage land or petroleum polluted soil mainly contains various polycyclic, linear, and aromatic compounds that hamper the growth of the plants (Wyszkowski and Zi&#x000f3;lkowska <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). In certain cases, it renders the land of no use. Degradation of the hydrocarbons and nutrient cycling can establish vegetation again. In the line of these attempts, people are trying to exploit the potential of soil microbes possessing degradation capabilities of hydrocarbons (Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Phenol, toluene, xylene, and hexane are a few hydrocarbons usually present in the spillage sites. Recently, we showed that incubating mung seedlings with these compounds proved to be highly toxic in the case of phenol, followed by hexane, xylene and toluene. Various metabolomic parameters, such as total protein content, total soluble sugar, total reducing sugar, and total phenolic contents, significantly reduced at increasing concentration of the compounds (Gupta and De 2015). In this study, treated mung seedlings with phenol, toluene, xylene, and hexane showed significant reduction in root shoot length as compared to the control group. To counter this effect, isolated bacterial culture was inoculated in the medium, for the degradation of the compound and rendering the seedlings to grow, showing an enhancement of the root shoot length as compared with the treated groups. <italic>Proteus</italic> sp. was found to be the most promising among them. To understand the degradative potential of the bacterial isolates, plasmid profiling was done, yielding a band of nearly 4.5-kb common for all the isolates, serving as a clue to be the most probable plasmid involved in degradation of those compounds. The results from this study clearly indicate that <italic>Proteus</italic> sp. can be explored further in the future for its degradative capability and plant synergism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>The study was conducted in Dr. B. Lal Institute of Biotechnology, Jaipur. Soil sample was collected from a petroleum station contaminated with petrol and diesel. The mung seeds, <italic>Vigna radiata</italic> Virat HY45, were collected from a certified dealer. All the reagents and solvents were procured from a local supplier, of highest purity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Enrichment, isolation, and identification of bacteria</title><p>The bacterial suspension was prepared by dissolving 1&#x000a0;g of soil sample in 10&#x000a0;ml of 0.1&#x000a0;% saline solution and thoroughly mixed. The primary enrichment of bacteria was carried out using two sets of trypticase soy broth, one containing sodium azide to permit the growth of Gram positive bacteria and the other containing crystal violet, phenol red to permit the growth of Gram negative bacteria selectively. Each flask was supplemented with 100&#x000a0;ppm of the compound to get only those bacterial isolates capable of degrading them. The flasks were incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x000a0;h in an orbital shaker. The secondary enrichment of bacteria was carried out by streaking the bacterial culture obtained from primary enrichment, on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 100&#x000a0;ppm of the compound and incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x000a0;h. The colonies obtained were examined for their morphology and Gram staining was performed to categorize them into Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.

The plasmid samples were run on 5&#x000a0;% native gel stained with ethidium bromide.

Oil spillage or fuel oil contamination in any area increases the toxic hydrocarbon loads on the soil, which in turn affects the agriculture and vegetation. The hydrocarbons and xenobiotics takes years to degrade, so the process is usually speeded up by bioremediation processes such as using bacteria that can degrade those toxic compounds. For example, <italic>Proteus</italic> sp. can grow on hexane, toluene and able to degrade benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) from heavily sites. <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp. can also degrade phenol from oil contaminated soil (Mohite et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). <italic>Enterococcus</italic> sp. can grow on hexane, xylene, and degrade azodyes released through textile industry effluent (Mate and Pathade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>). However, to use the bacterial isolates, we need to test the synergism of them with the plants, so both can coexist together. Results from this study confirm that the bacterial isolates were very well synergistic with the seedlings, and <italic>Proteus</italic> sp. was the best among them. The hydrocarbons degradative potential of any bacteria is mainly attributed to its plasmids present which carries genes for the degradation, for example, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. possess XYL plasmid that can degrade xylene (Friello et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1976</xref>). A common molecular weight of 4.5&#x000a0;kb plasmid suggests that it can be the most probable plasmid involved in the degradation of the compounds. To confirm the synergism of bacteria with plant, there must be some enhancement in the growth profile of the stressed plant compared to the normal one. The enhancement in the root shoot length of the seedlings in presence of <italic>Proteus</italic> sp. is statistically significant compared to the control, which suggest it to be an excellent candidate for use, to deal with oil spillage or fuel contaminated soil and restore the vegetation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The bacterial isolates were significantly synergistic to the seedlings and possess degradative potential. <italic>Proteus</italic> sp. is the best among others, in terms of the enhancement in root shoot length of the seedlings and degrading the hydrocarbons. <italic>Proteus</italic> sp. can be explored further in the future for its use in fuel contaminated land reclamation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. B.
