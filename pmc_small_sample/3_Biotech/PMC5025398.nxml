<italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> subsp. <italic>paratuberculosis</italic> (Map) contains PE family antigens which are Proline and glutamic acid rich and may play important role as T-cell antigens. In the present study, the Map&#x000a0;1507 ORF encoding 9.7&#x000a0;kDa PE protein was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into <italic>E. coli</italic> vector pQE30 UA. The recombinant plasmid designated as pQ PE was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> M15 cells and induced with IPTG revealed the high level expression of 11.9&#x000a0;kDa His-fusion protein as estimated by migration in 15&#x000a0;% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Recombinant PE protein was purified by Ni&#x02013;NTA agarose chromatography. Polyclonal antibodies raised against purified recombinant PE protein reacted with expressed PE protein as well as with Map sonicate. The recombinant PE protein was also recognized by serum from goat with clinical paratuberculosis. The protein elicited significant delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reaction in mice sensitized with Map. The results indicated that the recombinant PE protein of Map was associated with T-cell response.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Map</kwd><kwd>PE</kwd><kwd>pQE30 UA</kwd><kwd>Purification</kwd><kwd>DTH</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The search for <italic>M.a.paratuberculosis</italic> (Map)-specific antigens for diagnostic or preventive therapy has led to the discovery of several immunoreactive proteins. Many of these proteins have homology to other mycobacterial antigens.</p><p>Little is known about the structure, function, or immunological response to the PE proteins encoded by the subfamily of PE genes found throughout the genome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and other mycobacteria (Khubaib et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>; Deng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>; Fishbein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>; Brennan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>; Fleischmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2002</xref>). These PE genes encode proteins that range in size from ~30 to ~110 amino acids, and most contain a characteristic Pro-Glu (PE) amino acid motif near the N terminus. Similar sequences are found as the N-terminal domain of the larger subfamily of proteins that contain polymorphic glycine repeat sequences (PE_PGRS) (Brennan and Delogu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2002</xref>). Studies using reverse transcriptase PCR and microarray analyses (Fisher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>; Voskuil et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>) revealed that certain PE genes are expressed by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. It has also been reported that PE 35 gene that was found in RD1, a multigene region that is absent in Mycobacterium bovis BCG strains, can elicit an immune response (Brusasca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>). <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> genome contains only a few PE genes and no PE_PGRS genes (Parra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>).</p><p>Parra et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>) have shown that a PE protein of <italic>M. avium</italic> is a potent T cell inducer and capable of eliciting significant amounts of IFN&#x003b3; in experimental mice model. Immunization of mice with a novel PE gene expressed by <italic>M. avium</italic> (MaPE) showed that a dominant T-cell immune response was elicited. Immunization with a MaPE DNA vaccine protected mice against an aerosol challenge with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, suggesting that mycobacteria expressed PE antigens with cross-protective T-cell epitopes. Hence the identification and expression of PE antigen that stimulate T cell response seem to be an initial requirement for the development of effective vaccines and or CMI based diagnostic. The present communication deals with the cloning expression, purification and preliminary characterization of the 9.7&#x000a0;kDa PE protein of Map in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mycobacterial strains</title><p>Bacterial strain of Map&#x000a0;316F were obtained from Central Diengenees Kunding Tieh Instituut, Lelystad, The Netherlands in Biological Products Division of IVRI, Izatnagar, and later maintained at Gene Expression lab, Division of Animal Biotechnology.

A few antigens from the PE family protein Mtb and Map have reported to elicit T cell response (Delogu and Brennan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>) or some of them are involved to mediate humoral immune response (Narayana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>). The completion of Map genome has provided information about several ORFs from PE family proteins. In the present study, we have selected a sequence of 300&#x000a0;bp from the Map genome and <italic>E. coli</italic> expression system pQE30 UA, to produce 9.7&#x000a0;kDa protein of Map for further studies.</p><p>The whole cell extract of <italic>E. coli</italic> harboring plasmid pQE PE induced by IPTG showed a predominant band of 11.9&#x000a0;kDa corresponding to expected size of PE fusion protein. The expressed recombinant 6X His tag fusion protein could be purified by Ni&#x02013;NTA affinity chromatography. Although a variety of heterologous expression systems have been developed to produce recombinant proteins, the purification of proteins obtained still remains problematic (Goswami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1996</xref>). The presence of 6X-histidine residues at N-terminal of the fusion protein enabled us to purify the protein by single step affinity purification by using Ni&#x02013;NTA resin (Deb and Goswami <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). In the present study, recovery of the purified PE fusion protein was more than 90&#x000a0;% after 6&#x000a0;h of induction. Similarly, cloning in pQE series expression vector system was utilized to generate high levels of 35&#x000a0;kDa protein of Map (Basagoudanawar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>) and a 26&#x000a0;kDa protein of <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>) and 34.9&#x000a0;kDa PPE antigen of Map (Deb and Goswami <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). The polyclonal sera raised in mice against the recombinant His-PE protein recognized both the <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed PE protein as well as the PE protein in Map culture sonicate on dot and western blot analysis indicating that the immunogenic nature of PE protein was not affected by expression in a heterologous expression system.</p><p>Delay type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction is an indicator of T cell mediated immunity towards mycobacterial infection (Orme et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1993</xref>). In the present study we observed the DTH responses in all the animals sensitized with Map using recombinant PE protein as well as johnin PPD. A better response was detected in the groups sensitized with Johnin PPD which may be due to polyclonal activation of T cells by multiple antigenic components in these preparations, compared to the single antigenic component of the recombinant PE protein. These results corroborated with earlier findings by Deb and Goswami (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). This piece of information may postulate that Map PE may be a potent immune stimulating antigen and can be used as reference antigen for developing novel recombinant therapeutics/diagnostics against paratuberculosis infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are thankful to the Director ICAR-IVRI, Izatnagar, India for providing the necessary facilities to conduct the present study.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>We declared that none of the authors have any kind of conflict of interest for the present study.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Basagoudanawar</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Goswami</surname><given-names>PP</given-names></name><name><surname>Tiwari</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cellular immuneresponse to 35&#x000a0;kDa recombinant antigen of <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> paratuberculosis</article-title><source>Vet Res Commun</source><year>2005</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>209</fpage><lpage>224</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1023/B:VERC.0000017371.68083.04</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR002"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Bjerrum OJ, Schafer-Nielsen C (1986) In: Dunn (ed) Electrophoresis 86 VCH, Weinheim, Germany, pp 315</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR02"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brennan</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title> The tuberculosis vaccine challenge</article-title><source>Tuberculosis</source><year>2005</year><volume>85</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>7</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.tube.2004.09.001</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15687021</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brennan</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Delogu</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The PE multigene family: a &#x02018;molecular mantra&#x02019; for mycobacteria</article-title><source>Trends Microbiol</source><year>2002</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>246</fpage><lpage>249</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0966-842X(02)02335-1</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11973159</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brusasca</surname><given-names>PN</given-names></name><name><surname>Colangeli</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lyashchenko</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Vogelstein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Spencer</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>McMurray</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name><name><surname>Gennaro</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Immunological characterization of antigens encoded by the RD1 region of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> genome</article-title><source>Scand J Immunol</source><year>2001</year><volume>54</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>448</fpage><lpage>452</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1046/j.1365-3083.2001.00975.x</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11696195</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Deb R, Goswami PP (2010) Expression of a gene encoding 34.9&#x000a0;kDa PPE antigen of <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> subsp. <italic>paratuberculosis</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic>.
