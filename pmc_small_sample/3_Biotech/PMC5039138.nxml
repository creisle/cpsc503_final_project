These hydrolyze proteins into short peptides or free amino acids. Proteases do not refer to a single enzyme, but a mixture of enzymes including proteinases and amidases (Qureshi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). These enzymes have versatile applications in various industries, such as detergents, food, pharmaceutical, leather, silk, silver recovery and production of protein hydrolysates (Annamalai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>). Proteases are also envisaged as having extensive applications in the development of eco-friendly technologies as well as in several bioremediation processes (Jisha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>). Microbial proteases constitute one of the most important groups of industrial enzymes and their dominance in the industrial market is expected to increase further in coming years. Among different types (acidic, neutral and alkaline) of proteases, alkaline proteases are the most commonly used industrial enzyme in view of their activity and stability at high pH (Denizci et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>; Devi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>).</p><p>Microbial proteases are usually produced by either free or immobilized cells. Immobilized whole cell/enzyme production offers several advantages such as better operational stability due to biocatalyst and high efficiency of catalysis. Immobilization of an enzyme allows for easy separation of the enzyme from the products and for recycling of the enzyme (Demirkan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>). Immobilized cells are used in food technology, biotechnology, biomedicine and analytical chemistry (Kumar and Vats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). It offers various advantages, such as increase of productivity due to the high cell concentration within the reactor, prevention of washout in continuous operation among others (Sankaralingam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>) and the ability to separate cell mass from the bulk liquid for possible reuse (Kumar and Vats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). However, proper selection of immobilization techniques and supporting materials is needed to minimize the disadvantages of immobilization. Generally, enzymes or cells are immobilized by physical adsorption, ionic binding, covalent binding, cross-linking and entrapment methods. Entrapment method has been considered most suitable among the various reported methods. It consists of enclosing the enzyme or cell in an aqueous solution inside a semi-permeable membrane capsule. It is possible to immobilize several enzymes or cells at the same time (Demirkan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>). Thus in the present study, the potential of various matrices for immobilization of alkaline protease and <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> SP1 was investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bacterial strain and growth conditions</title><p>Previously isolated <italic>B. amyloliquifaciens</italic> SP1 (Accession Number KF923792) from apple rhizosphere of Chamba District, Himachal Pradesh, India, was used.

During use, their stability decreases due to changes in pH, temperature, conformational changes as a result of friction, osmotic pressure imposed by the environs on their use, and a cumulative effect of all these factors as a function of duration of their use. Secondly, since they are soluble, their recovery from a mixture of substrate and product for reuse is not economically practical, rendering the costly enzymatic process even more costly (Kotwal and Shankar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>). Among different techniques, entrapment in agar and calcium alginate gel offers many advantages due to its simplicity and nontoxic character (Gangadharan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>).</p><p>The prerequisites of immobilization of enzyme are proper permeability and rigidity of beads. For this concentration of agar, sodium alginate and polyacrylamide need to be optimized. Data appended in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> reveal that the maximum entrapped protease activity was obtained with 2&#x000a0;% agar, 3&#x000a0;% sodium alginate and 10&#x000a0;% polyacrylamide beads. This indicates that alkaline protease activity was minimum when the concentrations of different matrices were low. This may be due to the high permeability of different matrices at low concentration. However, the protease activity decrease at higher concentration of agar (3&#x000a0;%) and polyacrylamide (12&#x000a0;%) was due to decreased gel porosity with increase in gel concentration and, consequently, resulted in diffusion limitation (Ahmed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). Similar results were observed previously for other entrapped enzymes (Lamas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>; Samia and Ahmed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>).</p><p>The reusability of the immobilized enzyme is very important from the point of view of reducing the cost of the enzyme. This is an important factor while considering its suitability for commercial applications (Tanksale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>). The results of the present work revealed that after five reuses, 25.63, 22.05 and 34.04&#x000a0;% activity was obtained as compared to their first use with calcium alginate-, agar- and polyacrylamide-entrapped enzymes, respectively. This may be due to the leakage of enzyme from the beads during their use and washing at the end of each cycle (Geethanjali and Subash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). Anwar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>) reported entrapment of protease in calcium alginate beads and decrease in protease activity after three reuses. Another study stated that &#x003b1;-amylase entrapped in calcium alginate beads could be reused for six cycles with about 30&#x000a0;% loss in activity (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>). Thus, polyacrylamide-entrapped alkaline protease of <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> SP1 showed very high retaining and reuse ability as compared to that already reported.</p><p>Whole cell immobilization is one of the common techniques for increasing the overall cell concentration and productivity. Among the immobilization methods for microbial cells, entrapment is the most suitable and common method. Immobilization by entrapment is known to be a simple and gentle procedure and protects the cells from unfavorable conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) from the surrounding media (Kumar and Vats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). Whole cell immobilization technique is generally used for higher productivity by protecting the cells from shear forces. In addition to this, the product and the cell can easily be separated, so that the cells can be reused several times (Adinarayana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>). Immobilization of cells may allow continuous operation of cultivation at high dilution rates. This strategy protects the cells from shear forces. Immobilization of protease-producing cells has been performed by different authors (Rao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>; Anwar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Sankaralingam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>; Geethanjali and Subash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>).</p><p>Different matrices like agar, calcium alginate and polyacrylamide were used for immobilization of a definite amount of logarithm phase, <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> SP1 cells. Similarly, a free cell system of equal initial cell concentration was also run (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The present investigation revealed the optimum incubation period of different matrices for alkaline protease production. The data indicated that protease production in different matrices started from 24&#x000a0;h and reached maximum at 48&#x000a0;h in case of agar and polyacrylamide matrices, whereas for calcium alginate matrix the maximum alkaline protease production was achieved in 60&#x000a0;h. The results of the present investigation is in disagreement with previous studies (Adinarayana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>; Kumar and Vats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>) that showed a higher level of alkaline protease production in 24&#x000a0;h by agar, polyacrylamide and calcium alginate matrices. However, the results are in agreement with those from other investigations that found 48&#x000a0;h as optimum incubation time for these matrices-entrapped cells (Sankaralingam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>). The production of alkaline protease was found to be associated with the population of the cells in the medium, resulting from the multiplication of the number of immobilized cells leaked from the beads, i.e., cell leakage population which increased up to 48&#x000a0;h in case of agar and polyacrylamide immobilization and up to 60&#x000a0;h in case of calcium alginate immobilization. This implies that the number of entrapped cells gradually decreases with increase in incubation time and so is the case with alkaline protease production (Adinarayana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>).</p><p>The results in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> indicate that maximum alkaline protease production, i.e., 4200&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml/min, was detectable after 48&#x000a0;h with polyacrylamide-entrapped cells as compared to other immobilized matrices and free cell system, Polyacrylamide was earlier successfully used for immobilization of many enzyme systems. It was used for the immobilization of cells for the production of other primary metabolites (Adinarayana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>). The results of the present investigation are in line with the findings of Abdel-Naby et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1998</xref>) and Kumar and Vats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>), who has reported maximum alkaline protease production by <italic>B. mycoides</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> on polyacrylamide matrix as compared to agar, gelatin and calcium alginate. Although alkaline protease titer obtained with other matrices such as agar, calcium alginate was low, but these natural polymers were also employed for cell immobilization. They employed gel as a carrier material for the immobilization of different enzyme systems which include protease (Rao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>), &#x003b2;-galactosidase and penicillin acylase (Ramakrishna and Prakasham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1999</xref>). It is evident that the alkaline protease production was higher with immobilized cells (4200&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml/min) than that of free cells (3450&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml/min).</p><p>The semi-continuous fermentation was terminated to investigate the stability of the biocatalysts and their ability to produce alkaline protease under repeated batch cultivation conditions. Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> show the possibility for reuse of the polyacrylamide-immobilized cells to produce alkaline protease in semi-continuous mode. The results revealed that the amount of enzyme production with polyacrylamide-immobilized cells gradually decrease in alkaline protease titer from the first batch onward. At the same time, the gradual cell leakage from the gel was observed from the first to the ninth batch. There is no disintegration of the beads; however, a huge loss of protease activity was observed as compared to the first batch of fermentation. Thus, the repeated batch fermentation with polyacrylamide beads was successfully run for nine batches (18&#x000a0;days). These findings were in accordance with those obtained previously for the protease production by immobilized <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. in polyacrylamide beads (Sankaralingam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>). The agar and calcium alginate-entrapped cells were also used for repeated batch fermentation. The behavior for these systems was similar to polyacrylamide cells. With all these systems, relatively low enzyme titer was observed when compared with polyacrylamide cells. Also, the cell leakage from the respective gels was more and gel cubes of agar disintegrated after five batches of fermentation.</p><p>Thus, polyacrlyamide was found superior to other matrices, as a maximum total protease titer (24,847&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml/min) was obtained with this system which was higher than that in other reports. The present study reported that even after the immobilized cells had been in use for about 18&#x000a0;days, it still possessed significant alkaline protease production. It has been shown that immobilized cells were able to produce alkaline protease consistently and that they might be used for continuous alkaline protease production (Beshay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>).</p><p>In the present investigation, the role of immobilized alkaline protease produced by <italic>B. amyloliqefaciens</italic> SP1 in detergent was studied. Rapid bloodstain removal was noticed with supplementation of commercially available detergents, i.e., Ariel with immobilized protease in less than 25&#x000a0;min. However, individual treatment of distilled water, detergent (1&#x000a0;% Ariel) and immobilized enzyme was not able to remove stains. There are few reports showing the use of immobilized protease as detergent additive; however, similar results were noticed with protease of <italic>B. alveayuensis</italic> CAS 5 (Annamalai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study reported immobilization of detergent stable, alkalophilic protease and rhizobacteria, i.e., <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> SP1 having multifarious plant growth-promoting traits. The highest enzyme production was recorded in cells immobilized with polyacrylamide (4200&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml/min) after 48&#x000a0;h of incubation. Results also revealed that the amount of protease yield with immobilized cells gradually decreased from the end of the first batch due to cell leakage. However, repeated batch fermentation performed well in the case of polyacrylamide-immobilized cells that ran in nine batches. Similar results were obtained with immobilization of the enzyme. Maximum enzyme activity (5698.99&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml/min) resulted when protease was immobilized in polyacrylamide matrix (10&#x000a0;%) as compared to calcium alginate (2829.92&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml/min at 3&#x000a0;%), agar (2600&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml/min at 2&#x000a0;%) and free cell system (3580&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml/min). The potential application of immobilized alkaline protease of <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> SP1 in the detergent industry and the need of development of economic methods for improved enzyme production make whole cell and enzyme immobilization excellent alternative methods.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the INSPIRE Program, Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, for providing fellowship and facilities.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdel-Naby</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ismail</surname><given-names>AMS</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Abdel Fattah</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Production and immobilization of alkaline protease from <italic>Bacillus mycoides</italic></article-title><source>Bioresour Technol</source><year>1998</year><volume>64</volume><fpage>205</fpage><lpage>210</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0960-8524(97)00160-0</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adinarayana</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Bezawada</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Poluri</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Production of alkaline protease with immobilized cells of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PE-11 in various matrices by entrapment technique</article-title><source>AAPS Pharm Sci Tech</source><year>2005</year><volume>6</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>391</fpage><lpage>397</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1208/pt060348</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramadan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Domany</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Nefisa El-Shayeb</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Hesham</surname><given-names>Saleh SA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Optimization, immobilization of extracellular alkaline protease and characterization of its enzymatic properties</article-title><source>Res J Agri Biol Sci</source><year>2010</year><volume>4</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>434</fpage><lpage>446</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Annamalai N, Rajeswari MV, Balasubramanian T (2013) Extraction, purification and application of thermostable and halostable alkaline protease from <italic>Bacillus alveayuensis</italic> CAS 5 using marine wastes.
