In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL) and PCL/gelatine (Ge) (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated using a less toxic and common solvent, formic acid and an electrospinning technique. Nanofibrous scaffolds were coated with silver (Ag) in different concentrations of silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>) aqueous solution (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10&#x000a0;%) by using dipping method, drying and followed by ultraviolet (UV) photoreduction. The PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffold had an average fibre diameter of 155.60&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;41.13&#x000a0;nm. Characterization showed that Ag was physically entrapped in both the PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds. Ag<sup>+</sup> ions release study was performed and showed much lesser release amount than the maximum toxic concentration of Ag<sup>+</sup> ions in human cells. Both scaffolds were non-toxic to cells and demonstrated antibacterial effects towards Gram-positive <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (<italic>B. cereus</italic>) and Gram-negative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>). The Ag/PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffold has potential for tissue engineering as it can protect wounds from bacterial infection and promote tissue regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Polycaprolactone (PCL)</kwd><kwd>Gelatine (Ge)</kwd><kwd>Silver (Ag)</kwd><kwd>Nanofibrous scaffold</kwd><kwd>Antibacterial property</kwd><kwd>Cytotoxicity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003093</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4F507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sultana</surname><given-names>Naznin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Tissue engineering has emerged to provide a new medical therapy in helping tissue regrowth and regeneration (Sultana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>; Groeber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>). It employs a scaffold as an artificial supporting structure for cellular growth. There are many techniques in scaffold fabrication, including electrospinning (Hassan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>; Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>; Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>). The electrospinning technique was used in this research as it produces a fibrous scaffold that mimics the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) of the dermis. This technique uses an electric field to convert a polymer solution into fibres by creating a charged jet of polymer solution that is ejected and travels in the air to form micro- and nano-sized fibres (Rujitanaroj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>).</p><p>To fabricate a scaffold, biomaterials such as biodegradable polymers are widely used as the material of the scaffold. Using a biodegradable polymer as the scaffold provides adequate support for cells and degrades at a rate coincident with tissue growth. Biodegradable polymers are divided into biodegradable synthetic polymers and natural polymers. In this study, a biodegradable synthetic polymer, polycaprolactone (PCL), and a natural polymer, gelatine (Ge), were used. Both of these polymers have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are safe for use in the human body (Kiran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>; GMIA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). Some studies have observed that PCL fibrous scaffolds cause a reduction in cell attachment, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>). Cell affinity toward synthetic polymers is usually poorer than toward natural polymers. PCL has the advantages of biodegradability and biocompatibility, but it has lower hydrophilicity, a slower degradation rate, and lacks surface cell-recognition sites (Chong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Ge is a natural polymer derived from collagen, the main structural component of the ECM of skin. It is hydrophilic and has a faster degradation rate. Due to the merits of its biological origin, it was selected to be blended with PCL to achieve the desired fibrous scaffold to mimic the ECM with enhanced wettability, a faster degradation rate, and improved cell attachment as well as proliferation.</p><p>Although the choice of biomaterial is crucial to wound healing, bacterial colonization and infection can also affect the healing process of deep dermal injuries. Some studies have been conducted to incorporate antibiotic or antibacterial agents to inhibit the growth of bacteria. Incorporation of a hydrophilic antibiotic (Mefoxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, cefoxitin sodium) into poly(lactide-<italic>co</italic>-glycolide) (PLGA) nanofibrous scaffolds was found to inhibit the growth of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>). Electrospun Ge fibres containing silver (Ag) nanoparticles have shown antibacterial activity against <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), and methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Rujitanaroj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>). It has also been reported that metal ions such as zinc, copper, and Ag have strong antibacterial activity (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>; Ibrahim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>; Depan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>). Ag is the most well-known metallic antibacterial agent and has been used in various biomedical applications. The maximum toxic concentration of Ag for human cells is 10&#x000a0;mg/L (Vik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1985</xref>). High concentrations of Ag may cause cytotoxicity, but low concentrations of Ag are non-toxic and safe for medical use (Stani&#x00107; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Alt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2004</xref>; Xing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study, PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) fibrous scaffolds were fabricated using the electrospinning technique. These scaffolds were not incorporated with an antibacterial agent, which might cause bacterial infection and inflammation in the wound. Hence, integration of an antibacterial agent on scaffold is worth investigating. Ag was coated on the PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) fibrous scaffolds and tested for in vitro cell cytotoxicity on human skin fibroblasts (HSF) as well as antibacterial activities using bacteria that cause skin and wound infections: <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (<italic>B. cereu</italic>s) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (Bottone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; John et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>; Rennie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2000</xref>; Church et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>).

Comparing the ATR spectra of the PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds, two different bands were observed in the ATR spectrum of the PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffold, i.e., amide I at 1657&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and amide II at 1540&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The band at 1657&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> represents carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibrations of the amide groups of Ge and the band at 1540&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> represents the stretching of C&#x02013;N bonds and bending of N&#x02013;H bonds (Chong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Oraby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>). In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, there was no shifting or additional bonding with Ag. Ag was not bonded to either the carbonyl groups of PCL or the amide groups of Ge. In conclusion, Ag was simply physically bonded to the PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds. Physically bonded Ag can be released easily from scaffolds to kill bacteria in a wound.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>ATR spectra of Ag-coated PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_531_Fig6_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig>
</p><p>Antibacterial agents are needed especially at the primary stage to kill existing bacteria on a wound. As the pore size of nanofibres is relatively much smaller than the size of a bacterium, nanofibres can have sieve effect to block the penetration of bacteria and effectively prevent exogenous infection (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Ag<sup>+</sup> ion release study</title><p>The antibacterial property of a scaffold depends on the role of Ag on the scaffold and its release behaviour. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the accumulated Ag<sup>+</sup> ion release from the Ag/PCL and Ag/PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds after incubation in PBS for 1, 3, and 7&#x000a0;days. The amount of Ag<sup>+</sup> ion release increased gradually until day 3 and decreased on day 7. Ag was physically attached to the PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds. Hence, Ag<sup>+</sup> ions could be easily released from the nanofibrous scaffolds. A cell cytotoxicity study was performed to evaluate the toxicity of these scaffolds towards human cells. During the incubation process, Ag was converted into Ag<sup>+</sup> ions and released from the nanofibrous scaffolds. Ag<sup>+</sup> ions were released rapidly at the beginning due to high surface area of nanofibrous scaffolds. This result is similar to the findings of other studies (Depan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>; Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>). It can be suggested that the Ag/PCL and Ag/PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds show antibacterial properties.

The zones of inhibition for Ag discs, PCL, PCL/Ge (70:30), Ag/PCL, and Ag/PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds after incubation were recorded. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows the inhibition zones at 4, 24, and 48&#x000a0;h. The inhibition zone was observed as a clear circular area surrounding the nanofibrous scaffolds indicating the zone of bacteria that was killed or prevented from growing.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Antibacterial activity of PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) at 4, 24, and 48&#x000a0;h</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_531_Tab2_HTML" id="MO8"/></table-wrap>
</p><p>The inhibition zone of the control (Ag discs) showed an excellent antibacterial effect. The antibacterial effect was greater towards <italic>E. coli</italic> compared to <italic>B. cereus</italic>. According to the results in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds did not have antibacterial properties as they showed no activity against either bacterium. However, according to Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, there was a clear inhibition zone around Ag-coated nanofibrous scaffolds for both bacteria, except for the Ag-coated PCL nanofibrous scaffold coated with the 1.25&#x000a0;% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution. This sample contained only 0.8&#x000a0;% Ag. This low concentration of Ag was not enough to kill the bacteria investigated. With an increase in the Ag content to 4.2&#x000a0;%, antibacterial properties were observed. There was no inhibition zone in the first and second hour as it takes time for Ag on the nanofibrous scaffolds to be ionized into Ag<sup>+</sup> ions. After 4&#x000a0;h, an inhibition zone was seen, and the diameter of the inhibition zone was similar out to 48&#x000a0;h for all Ag/PCL and Ag/PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds.</p><p>Dipping of nanofibrous scaffolds into an AgNO<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution is a simple and useful method to endow scaffolds with antibacterial properties. These results have shown that Ag exerts a strong antibacterial effect. Ag<sup>+</sup> ions are bioactive and, in sufficient concentrations, kill bacteria effectively as shown by the inhibition zone in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Cell cytotoxicity using the MTT assay</title><p>Ag-coated PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds were further investigated for cell cytotoxicity using the MTT assay.

</p><p>It has been reported that an Ag-coated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibrous scaffold coated with a 5&#x000a0;% w/v AgNO<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution was non-toxic to cells and showed good antibacterial activity; it also promoted wound healing in vivo in female Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>). Since Ag-coated scaffolds using a 5&#x000a0;% w/v AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution showed no cytotoxicity, it can be concluded that a concentration lower than a 5&#x000a0;% w/v AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution would be non-toxic as well. Therefore, in this study, only the PCL and PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffolds coated with the 10&#x000a0;% w/v AgNO<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution were investigated and were found to be non-toxic to cells.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ag was coated effectively on PCL and PCL/Ge nanofibrous scaffolds by using dipping method in AgNO<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution followed by photoreduction. Ag was physically bonded to the scaffolds and was non-toxic to cells. Ag concentration of at least 4.2&#x000a0;% was sufficient to exert antibacterial properties against <italic>B. cereus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. As average fibre diameter of the PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffold was in the range of the collagen fibre diameter in ECM, and should provide a similar environment for cell growth as that found in the body. Hence, the Ag/PCL/Ge (70:30) nanofibrous scaffold has excellent potential to be used as a promising scaffold with antibacterial properties for tissue engineering applications to prevent bacterial infection and promote tissue regeneration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by MOHE, GUP Tier 1 grants (Vot: 06H84) and FRGS (Vot: 4F507).
