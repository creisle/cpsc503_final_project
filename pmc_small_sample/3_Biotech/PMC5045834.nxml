Natural plant products have shown their potentiality in controlling cancer while exhibiting less or no side effects and the use of plant extracts as complimentary to modern medicine is gaining increased popularity. Up to 80&#x000a0;% population in the developing countries is depending on herbal medicine to heal different diseases and they are inaccessible to allopathic medicine (Ekor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>; Pandey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>; Mzid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>). Some species of <italic>Andrographis</italic> gained its own importance due to their important medicinal values and an effective anti-cancerous source (Agbonlahor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>; Dhiman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>; Abhishek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>). Members of <italic>Andrographis</italic> are widely used in various ailments; particularly, <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> Nees (<italic>A. paniculata</italic>) used in the treatments of wide varieties of diseases in traditional systems of the medicine (Agbonlahor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>). <italic>A. paniculata</italic> extracts were tested against variety of cancer cell lines and reported that compounds isolated from the extracts exhibited potent anti-tumor activity against all the investigated cancer cell lines (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>; Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2014</xref>; Geethangili et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>; Rajagopal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>). It has also been showed that the methanol extract of <italic>A. paniculata</italic> was subjected to fractionation and reported that dichloromethane fraction of methanolic extract possessing cytotoxic activity and also potent immunostimulating activity (Sagadevan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>; Churiyah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>; Ajay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>). However, it was also reported that there were also adverse side effects of <italic>A. paniculata</italic> which may include gastric upset, headache, bitter taste and fatigue. Moreover, reports revealed that the high doses of <italic>A. paniculata</italic> may affect the normal functions of liver (Prakash et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). Hence, exploring more species of the <italic>Andrographis</italic> for medicinal properties including anticancer properties may prove to be worthwhile.</p><p>AN which was used in this study is procumbent herb, endemic to Nallamala hills, Andhra Pradesh, India. This herb was known to be used for treating mouth ulcers (Venkata Ratnam and Venkata Raju <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>) as well as leukoderma in folklore medicine and recent reports showed that parts of this herb were persisting antimicrobial and anti-psoriatic properties, respectively (Padma and Venkata Raju <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>; Parlapally et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>).

G2/M progression depends not only upon the expression of Cdk inhibitors but also on phosphorylation of Cdk1 (Cdc2), the indicative of Cdc2 activity, which is negatively regulated by the phosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15. Cdc25c is a protein phosphatase that activates Cdc2 by dephosphorylation. Cdc25c is phosphorylated at ser216 in response to DNA damage at G2/M checkpoint and interacts with members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins, leading to its sequestration in the cytoplasm and thereby preventing premature mitosis. We next assessed the effect of AN on Cdc25c phosphorylation status. Western blot analysis revealed that AN treatment increased the levels of phosphorylated Cdc25c (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). We also examined the effects of AN on Cdc25c protein expression, and observed that Cdc25c was significantly downregulated in AN-treated A375 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). The cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), formerly called Cdc2, interacts with cyclin B1 and forms Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex which regulates the progression from G2- to M phase. The effect of AN extracts on Cdk1 expression by qRT-PCR analysis was examined. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, AN treatment significantly reduces the expression of cdk1 dose dependently in A375 cells.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>

</p><p>To further examine whether AN induces CDK inhibitor proteins, p21 protein levels were measured using western blot analysis up on AN extract treatments on A375 cells. AN treatment also induced a significant increase in p21 protein expression dose dependently (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). The expression of p21 is regulated by either a p53-dependent or p53-independent mechanism. In addition, p53 induces the cell cycle arrest as well apoptosis by regulating the expression of its target genes p21 and PUMA. To know whether the growth-inhibitory effect of AN was dependent on p53 status, p53 protein levels were tested following treatment. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, the expression of p53 was significantly increased in A375 cells following AN treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>AN leaf extracts enhances the expression of apoptotic proteins in A375 cells</title><p>To better understand how AN extract induces apoptosis and reduced the cell survival of skin cancer cell lines; the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins which involved in apoptosis and cell survival was analyzed.

B16F10 cells that were transiently transfected with pNF-&#x003ba;B-Luc-Reporter plasmid, and pRL-TK (for normalization of transfection efficiency) plasmid, were treated with AN leaf extracts followed by TNF&#x003b1; stimulation.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and the numbers of cancer cases are gradually increasing globally. There are different kinds of medicines available in the market to treat the several types of cancer but till date no drug is found to be safe and effective. One of the major impediments in the cancer chemotherapy is the toxicity of the established chemotherapeutic drugs. In recent years, the use of plants and plant derived products has proved to be effective and safe in the treatment and management of several types of cancers. Currently, most of the research work on cancer drugs is based on plants and plants-derived natural products. Since ancient time, plant products were used for health benefits by all cultures as well as source of medicines (Ignacimuthu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>; Elujoba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2005</xref>; Tomlinson and Akerele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1998</xref>). Several natural products and their analogs have been identified as potent anti-cancer agents and the identification of anti-cancer property of various plants is being unraveled in significant manner. In the present study we have chosen a beautiful herb, endemic to few pockets of Nallamala hills in Indian peninsular, known for treating various ailments such as mouth ulcers and leukoderma in folklore medicine, persisting with antimicrobial and anti-psoriatic properties. Essentially, it is a rare plant with flourishing medicinal properties.</p><p>In the study, attempts were made to examine whether AN persists with any anti-cancerous properties such as anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic activities on A375 and B16F10 skin cancer cell lines. MTT cell viability assays and clonogenic assays revealed that AN leaf extracts have significant anti-proliferative effects on skin cancer cell lines. Further TUENL assays also demonstrated that AN induced the apoptosis of skin cancer cell lines. These results supports the notion that AN leaf extracts reduce the cell viability, and concomitantly activate the apoptosis.</p><p>Cell cycle checkpoints are important regulatory mechanisms that ensure the proper passage of cells through the cell cycle. The G2/M and G1/S checkpoints are critical in maintaining DNA integrity and essential in executing the proper cell cycle events. The G2/M checkpoint is one of the important check points that blocks the entry into mitosis when DNA is damaged (Taylor and Stark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>). It was known that loss of regulation of these checkpoints resulted into transformation and progression of cancer cells. A protein kinase complex consisting of a catalytic subunit, Cdk1 (previously known as cdc2) and the cyclin B protein (Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex) regulates the central and rate-limiting function in the transition from G2 to M phase (Norbury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1992</xref>). In response to DNA damage, the cdc2/cyclin B1 complex causes a delay in cell cycle progression at G2/M phase to allow DNA repair before cells enter mitosis. This was achieved by phosphorylating cytoskeleton proteins such as lamins and histone H1 (Johnson and Walker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>). Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex formation itself is not enough for cell cycle progression. However, the event of dephosphorylation of cdk1 at the Tyr-15 site through cdc25c phosphatase is required for the optimal activation of the cdk1/cyclin B1 complex (Sampath and Plunkett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>). In the present study, AN treatment of A375 skin cancer cells resulted in inhibition of various cell cycle proteins. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, alterations in the levels of various cell cycle proteins were estimated and found that a decrease in levels of Cdk1, cyclin B1 and cdc25c following AN extract treatment, suggests the inhibitory activities of AN leaf extracts on G2/M phase of cell cycle arrest.</p><p>The transcriptional factor p53 functions as a guardian of the genome by modulating appropriate responses to stress as well as DNA damage. In addition, several studies showed the significant role of p53 in cell cycle checkpoint control. It has been showed that p53 blocks cell cycle at G2/M phase through direct inhibition of cdc2 kinase (Taylor and Stark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>). It was also known that p53 regulate the G2/M phase transition through the induction of p21, a protein that normally inhibits cyclin B1-Cdc2 complexes in the cytoplasm (Bunz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1998</xref>) or through the induction of apoptosis (Shaw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1992</xref>). The present study revealed that AN leaf extract treatment resulted in stabilization of p53 protein expression. Further, it was found that several apoptotic genes including BAX, BAD were upregulated and survival genes such as Bcl-XL was down regulated in A375 skin cancer cell lines. Moreover, AN significantly increased the cleavage of Caspase-3. p21 is an inhibitor of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and its induction is mediated by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and plays essential roles in both G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage and cell senescence (Roninson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>). The study demonstrates that AN treatment significantly increased the expression of cdk inhibitor, p21 which contributed to the G2/M arrest and growth inhibition of A375 skin cancer cells.</p><p>Solar UV radiation-induced skin cancer or photocarcinogenesis is a complex process that involves a cascade of individual steps which includes apoptosis, proliferation, autophagy, DNA repair, checkpoint signaling, metabolism and inflammation. Several signaling pathways regulate the events. Of which NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway plays key roles in inflammation, cellular proliferation, and induction of cancers (Kim and He <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B is a family of dimeric transcription factors that play vital roles in diverse physiological processes and various human malignancies. NF-&#x003ba;B family includes RelA/p65, RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 and p52/p100. In unstimulated cells, NF-&#x003ba;B/Rel dimers are bound to I&#x003ba;B and retained in cytoplasm. In response to stimulus such as TNF&#x003b1;, LPS the I&#x003ba;B proteins are phosphorylated by an activated I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) complex at positions 32 and 36 followed by polyubiquitination and degradation by 26S proteasome releasing free NF-&#x003ba;B dimers. Then the p50/65 complex translocates to nucleus and binds to their target gene promoters and drives their transcription (Karin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>; Nishikori <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B is activated by UVB radiation and contributes to UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis (Syed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>). Because inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation has been linked with anti-tumor activities, it was hypothesized that AN mediates their effect at least partly through inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation. In this study, the inhibitory effects of AN extracts on nuclear translocation of p65 were examined. Results showed that TNF&#x003b1;-induced nuclear translocation and NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent reporter gene expression were inhibited following AN treatment. Moreover, AN extracts reduced the NF-kB reporter gene activation and also reduced the NF-kB targeted genes expression including IL-1 beta, IL-6 and cyclin D1.</p><p>In conclusion, methanolic leaf extracts of the endemic herb AN reduced the proliferation and induced apoptosis of skin cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that AN targets the G2/M phase by altering the expression of proteins involved in G2/M phase, by inducing expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and by inhibiting the NF-kB pathway activation. The findings might help in providing the rationale to initiating in vivo studies to examine the efficacy of AN as chemopreventive agent against skin cancer.</p></sec></body><back><notes
