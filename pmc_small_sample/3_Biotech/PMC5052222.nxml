This study investigated the effect of hyphal morphology on cellulase production in the hyper-cellulolytic mutant, <italic>T. reesei</italic> DES-15. With a distinct morphology, <italic>T. reesei</italic> DES-15 was obtained through Diethyl sulfite (DES) mutagenesis. The hyphal morphology of DES-15 batch-cultured in a 5-L fermentor was significantly shorter and more branched than the parental strain RUT C30. The cellulase production of DES-15 during batch fermentation was 66&#x000a0;% greater than that of RUT C30 when cultured the same conditions. DES-15 secreted nearly 50&#x000a0;% more protein than RUT C30. The gene expression level of a set of genes (<italic>cla4</italic>, <italic>spa2</italic>, <italic>ras2</italic>, <italic>ras1</italic>, <italic>rhoA</italic>, <italic>cdc42,</italic> and <italic>racA</italic>) known to be involved in hyphae growth and hyphal branching was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The transcriptional analysis of these genes demonstrated that a decrease in gene expressions might contribute to the increased hyphal branching seen in DES-15.

The high cost of lignocellulosic enzymes for lignocellulosic degradation is one of the most important limiting factors in the bio-refinery of lignocellulosic biomass (Wilson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). The bio-refinery industry currently uses lignocellulosic enzymes that are primarily produced by ascomycete fungi, such as species of <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, <italic>Penicillium</italic>, or <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (Gusakov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>). The enzymes are secreted into fermentation broths at high levels following submerged cultivation. Submerged cultivations permit the easy acquisition of secreted enzymes for downstream fermentation processes (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). Submerged cultures are generally employed for the large-scale production of filamentous fungi. Widely recognized as complex systems, submerged cultures could be influenced by many external factors, some of which can affect the hyphal morphology of filamentous fungi (Kaup et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). In most filamentous fungal fermentation, it is generally believed that the level of productivity is dependent on the ability of the fungus to achieve an optimal morphology (Krull et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). In <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, increasing the stirring speed and adjusting the glucose concentration promotes citric acid production, thereby resulting in changes to the fungal morphology (Papagianni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>; Amanullah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2002</xref>). The relationship between the external environment and fungal morphology has been comprehensively investigated as a means to optimize fungal morphology. Numerous studies have demonstrated that changing important parameters during the fermentation process, such as the initial spore concentration, medium composition, pH value, temperature, and agitation, can control fungal morphology (Gibbs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2000</xref>; Papagianni <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; Peciulyte et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> have been widely used in a broad range of industrial applications, and have become the main source of lignocellulosic enzymes (Dashtban et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>). Typically, when using submerged cultures for the large-scale production of cellulase, any alteration to the hyphal morphology of <italic>T. reesei</italic> can greatly influence cellulase yields (Domingues et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2000</xref>). It is generally believed that protein secretion by filamentous fungi primarily occurs at the young hyphal tips (Gordon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>), where the cell wall is more porous and facilitates rapid protein secretion (Chang and Trevithick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1972</xref>). The process of branching can lead to the emergence of more growing tips that are important for protein secretion (Peberdy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1994</xref>). Any internal or external factors that can increase the number of active tips have the potential to improve the overall protein yield (Juge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>). For example, Ahamed and Vermette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>) reported that the number of hyphal branching and hyphae tips could be controlled through manipulating agitation rates and culture medium composition, a method that could be employed to help improve cellulase activity. However, the previous studies were focused on manipulating only a single parameter, due to the extreme difficulty associated with simultaneously adjusting all influencing factors during fermentation. Nevertheless, obtaining a strain with optimal morphology in submerged cultures is an important factor for the production of cellulase by <italic>T. reesei</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we utilized a hyper-cellulolytic mutant (DES-15) with a unique morphology, where the hyphae appeared to be shorter and more branched during fermentation. DES-15 was originally obtained by dimethyl sulfate (DES) mutagenesis. During the fermentation process, cellulase productivity and protein secretion were significantly improved in the DES-15 mutant when compared to the RUT C30 strain. Furthermore, to elucidate the relationship between hyphal morphology and cellulase productivity, we preformed a transcriptional analysis on DES-15 to determine the genes involved in hyphal branching during the submerged culture process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fungal strains, media, and cultivation conditions</title><p>
<italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> RUT C30 (ATCC 56,765) was used as the parent strain all throughout this study. The hyper-producing cellulase mutant DES-15 was generated from the parent RUT C30 strain using diethyl sulfite (DES) mutagenesis, and was utilized throughout. All strains were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

The treated spores were then spread onto PDA and incubated at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days until colonies appeared. Single colonies were picked and seeded onto fresh PDA plates for purification, and inoculated into the fermentation medium for enzyme activity analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Enzyme production in shake flasks and in a laboratory-scale fermentor</title><p>Approximately 1&#x000a0;mL of spore suspension (10<sup>7</sup>&#x000a0;spores/mL) was inoculated into 250&#x000a0;mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30&#x000a0;mL of inoculum medium, and incubated with constant shaking (200&#x000a0;rpm) for 24&#x000a0;h at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. A total of 1.5&#x000a0;mL of pre-culture media was then inoculated into 250&#x000a0;mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30&#x000a0;mL of the fermentation medium (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>).

The dissolved oxygen (DO) was controlled at 30&#x000a0;% by varying the agitation speed and airflow rate. 10&#x000a0;% (v/v) silicone antifoaming agent (THIX 298, Yantai Hengxin Chemical Co., Ltd., China) was automatically added into the fermentor by the fermentor controlling system for foam controlling. 2&#x000a0;M ammonia or 2&#x000a0;M sulfuric acid was automatically added into the fermentor by the fermentor controlling system as needed to carefully maintain the culture pH. The bioreactor&#x02019;s working volume was 3-L, from which samples were periodically withdrawn, centrifuged at 6000&#x000a0;<italic>g</italic> for 5&#x000a0;min, and the enzymatic activities determined from the collected supernatants.

By this method, the mycelia weight was calculated from the difference between the total dry weight of the solid (mixture of mycelia and cellulose), and that of the residual cellulose. The dry weight of the solids was determined as follows: 20&#x000a0;mL of the cultures were centrifuged at 10,000&#x000a0;rpm for 20&#x000a0;min; then, the pellets were washed three times with 10&#x000a0;mL of water, and finally lyophilized until a constant weight was obtained.</p><p>The FPase activity was measured as described by Ghose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1987</xref>). Briefly, this method measures the release of the reducing sugars produced. The amount of reducing sugars produced was determined following a 60&#x000a0;min culture, where 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of an enzyme solution is mixed with 1&#x000a0;mL of citrate buffer (0.05&#x000a0;M, pH 4.8) in the presence of 50&#x000a0;mg of Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and incubated at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The FPase activity was represented by the filter paper unit (FPU), which was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol of reducing sugar in 1&#x000a0;min. The cellulase production for each strain was represented by its FPase activity in the fermentation broth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Microscopy</title><p>To examine the hyphal morphology, 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the mycelia samples was diluted in 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of distilled H<sub>2</sub>O, and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the diluted sample was placed onto a microscope slide. The slides (after heat fixation) were then observed and recorded using a CX-31, Olympus microscope. In each sample, at least 3000 hyphae were examined from 30 random bright fields. The single hypha length, hypha diameter, numbers of tips, and numbers of branches were measured using the IPP software (Image-Pro Plus 6, Media Cybernetics).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>The fungal mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed with distilled water, frozen, and then ground under liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol extraction method (Life Technologies, USA). cDNA synthesis was performed using a RevertAid&#x02122; H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, MA) using the oligo dT primers which were provided in the kit. To ensure the validity of our findings, we evaluated the RNA of each strain by Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to verify that no genomic DNA was carried over in the samples during the experimental process.</p><p>Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays were performed in an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Invitrogen&#x02122; Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Each reaction mixture contained 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the template cDNA (10&#x000a0;ng/&#x003bc;L), 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of SYBR premix (Takara, Japan), 0.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of both the forward and reverse PCR primers (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), and the volume of nuclease-free water required for a final volume of 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L. The PCR program is described as follows: first, there was an initial denaturation at 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;s, followed by 3&#x000a0;s at 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 30&#x000a0;s at 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (40&#x000a0;cycles). A melting curve was performed after each run to check the specificity of the PCR product. The qRT-PCR primers used are listed in Table S1. The samples were analyzed in at least two independent experiments with three replicates in each run. The transcript levels of the target genes were normalized against the transcript levels for the <italic>gpd1</italic> gene using the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method as has been previously described (Livak and Schmittgen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Screening of hyper-producing cellulase mutants</title><p>Using an excellent cellulase producer RUT C30, 100 mutants were obtained by DES mutagenesis and inoculated into Erlenmeyer flasks for FPA determination. Among them, five mutants showed enhanced cellulase activities. Using a sample of 20 clones (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the cellulase activity for the parent strain RUT C30 was determined to be 7.11&#x000a0;FPU/mL, while the cellulase activity of one hyper-producing cellulase mutant, DES-15, was determined to be 11.86&#x000a0;FPU/mL, a 66&#x000a0;% increase in the overall cellulase activity. In contrast, however, the cellulase activities of the other four mutants were only marginally enhanced, increasing by 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% when compared with the parent RUT C30. Given that DES-15 demonstrated the highest cellulase activity of the mutants, it was selected for further studies. The genetic stability of DES-15 was evaluated by determining the cellulase activity and secreted protein concentration in ten successive generations. The cellulase production and extracellular protein abundance of DES-15 were determined to be stable (Table S2).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Screening of hyper-cellulolytic mutants. As this is an initial screening, data are representative for a single liquid fermentation only</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_516_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>Submerged cultivation in a fermentor is mostly used in the large-scale production of cellulase, as many parameters are easier to control in fermentors compared to flasks during large-scale production (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). To comprehensively compare the cellulase production of DES-15 with RUT C30, we first sought to determine the extracellular protein levels, biomass, and FPase activity during cultivation in a 5-L fermentor with the same cultivation parameters. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, the FPase activity of DES-15 was higher than that of RUT C30 throughout the fermentation process, with a final FPase of approximately 69&#x000a0;% higher activity being achieved by DES-15 when compared to the FPase of RUT C30. The protein concentration during the fermentation of DES-15 reached 6.5&#x000a0;g/L, which was nearly 50&#x000a0;% higher than that obtained by RUT C30 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Surprisingly, the biomass of DES-15 was lower than that of RUT C30 throughout the fermentation process (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Biomass is considered to be one of the most important factors influencing productivity during submerged fermentation. However, although high productivity is generally achieved through increasing biomass, an overdose in biomass can limit the ability of oxygen to dissolve into the submerged cultures, resulting in impaired productivity (Olsvik and Kristiansen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1994</xref>; Wucherpfennig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>). In this study, we carefully controlled the influencing factors for all submerged cultures, demonstrating that the enhanced production of cellulase in DES-15 was independent of any variations in culture conditions. It is thus speculated that the enhanced production of cellulase in DES-15 might be due to an improved capacity for protein secretion, or a mutation leading to the increased transcription of cellulase genes as a result of the DES mutagenesis of RUT C30.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>FPase activity (<bold>a</bold>), protein concentration (<bold>b</bold>), and biomass (<bold>c</bold>) in batch culture.

Portnoy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>) assessed the transcription abundance of the transcription factor <italic>xyr1</italic> and the <italic>cbh1</italic> gene encoding cellobiohydrolase between the industrial hyper-producing strain, <italic>T. reesei</italic> CL847 and its obvious parent strain, RUT C30. The results showed that the expression of <italic>xyr1</italic> and <italic>cbh1</italic> was significantly higher in CL847 than it was in RUT C30. Among the known transcription factors, XYR1 is recognized as an essential transcription factor involved in cellulase/hemicellulase regulation in <italic>T. reesei</italic> (Mach-Aigner et al. 2008). To investigate whether the expression of <italic>xyr1</italic> was altered in the cellulase hyper-producing mutant DES-15 as a result of mutagenesis, qRT-PCR for the expression of <italic>xyr1</italic> was performed, and compared between the mutant DES-15 and the parent RUT C30 strain. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a&#x02013;c, the relative transcript abundance of <italic>xyr1</italic> was not significantly different in RUT C30 and its derivative DES-15 at any of the cultivation time points analyzed (0, 24, and 72&#x000a0;h). The expression levels of three other major cellulase genes <italic>cbh1</italic>, <italic>bgl1</italic>, and <italic>egl1</italic> were also measured by qRT-PCR. Again, no significant differences for any of the cellulase genes were observed between RUT C30 and DES-15, which were consistent with the equal expression levels of <italic>xyr1</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a&#x02013;c).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Hyphal morphology of the cellulase hyper-producing mutant DES-15 in 5-L fermentor</title><p>Having found that the transcript levels of the major cellulase genes and the transcription factor <italic>xyr1</italic> were not affected in DES-15, we investigated whether the protein secretion capacity of DES-15 was altered. It is generally believed that protein secretion in filamentous fungi mainly occurs at the tip of growing hyphae (W&#x000f6;sten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1991</xref>; Xiang and Morris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1999</xref>), as extracellular proteins are more easily passed through the cell walls in the tips. Branched hyphae result in an increase in the number of tips, and thus enhance the secretion of proteins into the fermentation broth (Wessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1993</xref>). Therefore, it is speculated that the hyphal morphology, especially branching of DES-15, may have been altered in the submerged cultures. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, the hyphae in the parent strain RUT C30 were elongated, and not highly branched. However, in contrast, the hyphae of the mutant DES-15 were shorter and more branched than those of their parent strain RUT C30 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). To accurately analyze the differences in hyphal morphology between DES-15 and RUT C30, their hyphal growth parameters were measured over time. Such measured parameters included the numbers of branches, numbers of tips, hyphae length, and hyphae diameter as seen in the 5-L fermentor. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, d shows that the DES-15 mutant has a greater mean number of branches and tips per hypha across the fermentation period. In addition, a larger hyphae diameter could be measured for DES-15 than the parent RUT C30 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), while the hyphae length was significantly longer in the RUT C30 parent strain than in the DES-15 mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). In <italic>T. reesei</italic>, the hyphae morphology, particularly the number of hyphae tips, can be altered by many factors, such as agitation and culture medium composition (Papagianni <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Ahamed and Vermette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>). In this study, the mean number of tips per hypha in the DES-15 mutant was significantly greater than those seen for the RUT C30, largely due to DES-15&#x02032;s highly branched hyphae that were observed throughout the fermentation process. The results revealed that the mutagenesis of RUT C30 led to the significant changes in the morphology of DES-15, specifically with regard to branching. These changes likely contribute to the enhanced protein secretion capacity of DES-15 seen during submerged cultivation.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Hyphae morphology of the cellulase hyper-producing mutant DES-15 and the parent strain RUT C30 after 60&#x000a0;h cultivations. <bold>a</bold> RUT C30. <bold>b</bold> DES-15. <italic>Bars</italic> 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_516_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Effect of highly branching hyphae on protein secretion</title><p>Having demonstrated that DES-15 had a high capacity of protein secretion despite having a lower biomass compared to RUT C30, we sought to elucidate how these alterations to the branching of the hyphae affected protein secretion. To explore this question, the protein concentration of the same biomass of DES-15 and RUT C30 was determined. Inoculums with the same biomass were inoculated in the fermentation medium, and the protein concentration was measured every 2&#x000a0;h until the biomass differed. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the protein concentration of DES-15 was much higher than that of RUT C30 during the whole fermentation process, demonstrating that DES-15 possessed a higher protein secretion capacity than RUT C30. The results suggested that the cellulase production increase was due to the differential hyphal morphology of DES-15, and that this strain is thus particularly suitable for large-scale cellulase fermentation.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Protein concentration of RUT C30 and DES-15 with the same biomass.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Transcriptional analysis of the genes involved in hyphal branching</title><p>It has been previously reported that several genes are involved in hyphal branching in filamentous fungi (Harris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>). To identify the reasons for the highly branched morphology seen in DES-15 mutant, the expression levels of seven genes previously reported to be involved in branching (Cla4 protein ID 71315, RhoA protein ID 119871, Spa2 protein ID 108829, RacA protein ID 47055, Ras1 protein ID 120150, Ras2 protein ID 110960, and Cdc42 protein ID 50335) were examined by qRT-PCR at different cultivation times (Kwon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>). When comparing the initial time of cultivation (before batch, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a) to that at 24&#x000a0;h post-cultivation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b), the relative transcript abundances of <italic>cla4</italic>, <italic>ras2</italic>, <italic>ras1</italic>, <italic>spa2</italic>, <italic>rhoA</italic>, <italic>cdc42,</italic> and <italic>racA</italic> were significantly decreased in the DES-15 mutant when compared with the parent strain RUT C30.

</p><p>Both the extracellular environment and intercellular processes influence hyphal branching. Reported mutants with branching-specific phenotypes have suggested that branching formation does not involve a simple recapitulation of an established branching mechanism (Harris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>). Only a few genes have thus far been reported to influence branching in filamentous fungi. In <italic>Ashabya gossypii</italic>, <italic>Agcla4</italic> is required for the maturation of young hyphae. The development pattern of <italic>&#x00394;Agcla4</italic> was shown to be very similar to that of the wild type, apart from a slight increase in lateral branching (Ayad-Durieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2000</xref>). Mutations in <italic>AgSPA2</italic> have an effect on the hyphal tip growth speed and the overall branching density. Moreover, the apparent hyper-branching phenotype can be observed in the null mutants of <italic>AgSPA2</italic> (Knechtle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>). In addition, some members of GTPase proteins, such as RhoA, Ras1, Ras2, RacA, and Cdc42, play key roles in hyphae growth, especially with regard to hyphal branching in filamentous fungi. RhoA plays a role in the emergence of the secondary germ tubes and branches in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>. Two different mutants <italic>rhoA</italic>
<sup>G14V</sup> and <italic>rhoA</italic>
<sup>E40I</sup> obtained from the site directed mutagenesis and performed different phenotypes. The emergence of lateral branches in the <italic>rhoA</italic>
<sup>G14V</sup> strain was delayed and branches were clustered, while in the <italic>rhoA</italic>
<sup>E40I</sup>, the emergence of secondary and tertiary germ tubes and branches was accelerated, and lateral branches emerged in irregular numbers (Guest et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>). In <italic>T. reesei</italic>, the <italic>&#x00394;TrRas1</italic> strain exhibited highly branched, swollen hyphal cells, in contrast to its parent strain TU-6. The <italic>&#x00394;TrRas2</italic> mutant formed aggregated hyphae displaying a hyper-branching phenotype (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). The same phenomenon was also found in the null mutant of Ras2/RasB in <italic>N. crassa</italic> and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (Momany <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2002</xref>). In the important biological control agent <italic>Nomuraea rileyi</italic>, the hyphae of the RNAi-silenced mutant <italic>racA</italic>RM were largely thicker with increased apical branching, whereas those of the RNAi-silenced mutant <italic>cdc42</italic>RM did not exhibit any observable differences, except for an increase in the number of branches when compared with the wild type strains (Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2014</xref>). It can, therefore, be concluded that these genes have the potential to negatively impact hyphal branching. These observations indicate that the decreased expression of these genes in DES-15 may contribute to the highly branched hyphae seen here, which is consistent with the results of previous studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This work focused on the effect of high-branching hyphae on cellulase production in a cellulase hyper-producing strain DES-15 that was obtained through the DES mutagenesis of the parent <italic>T. reesei</italic> strain RUT C30. In batch cultures, the hyphae of DES-15 were more highly branched and had a larger number of actively growing tips than those of its parent strain RUT C30, allowing for better protein secretion. The expression of genes thought to negatively regulate branching was shown to be significantly lower in DES-15 than in RUT C30.
