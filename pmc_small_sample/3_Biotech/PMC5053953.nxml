In the present study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized by using root extract of <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> an important medicinal plant. The AgNPs are characterized by spectral analysis; the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of AgNPs showed maximum absorption at 445&#x000a0;nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) data show that the O&#x02013;H hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acids, ester and ether groups and C&#x02013;O stretching of alcohols have been utilized in the formation of AgNPs. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data reveal that the AgNPs are face-centered cubic (fcc) in structure. The size was determined by particle size analyzer and atomic force microscope (AFM); the results reveal that AgNPs were spherical in shape and the average grain size is determined as 41.5&#x02013;46.5&#x000a0;nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs obtained show that AgNPs were roughly spherical and well dispersed with the sizes ranging from 10 to 45&#x000a0;nm&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;nm. The biofabricated AgNPs are extremely stable due to its high negative zeta potential &#x02212;34.1&#x000a0;mV which indicates that the nanoparticles are polydispered in nature.

In medical technology, green synthesis of nanomaterials is gaining importance. The application of silver nanoparticles has a wide range, which gives scope for further research in the field of fabrication of silver nanoparticles and their compounds of ionic silver (Willner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2006</xref>; Lou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>). Some of the very important applications of silver nanomaterials include antimicrobial properties, surface-enhanced Raman scattering effect and also catalytic activity (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>). It is already known that silver has been used as an antimicrobial agent for centuries, in the present days the repetition of antibiotics increasing threat of antibiotic resistance, caused by the exploitation of antibiotics. So, Scientists once again focus on the application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) (Sambhy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2006</xref>). Besides antimicrobial activity, silver nanoparticles have potential applications as intercalation material in batteries, as coatings in solar energy, in optical receptors, in bio-labeling, and as efficient biocatalysts in chemical reactions (Klaus-Joerger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>; Schultz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2000</xref>; Hayat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1989</xref>). As the result, the biologists developed interest in the field of nanotechnology and focused on new dimensions of research in nanoparticles synthesis and their applications are emerging at rapid pace as therapeutic tools (Simkiss and Wilbur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1989</xref>; Mann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1996</xref>; Kotakadi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">b</xref>; Gaddam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>). Thus, the biosynthesized AgNPs have a wide range of significant applications in bimolecular diagnostics, competent antimicrobial, therapeutics, catalysis and also in microelectronic devices (Litvin and Minaev <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>; Schultz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2000</xref>; Rai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>). Earlier reports on the synthesis of AgNPs by using synthetic humic acids reveals that the nanoparticles are very stable and can be useful in different biomedical applications (Litvin and Minaev <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>; Litvin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>). Since the last decade, regenerative medicine is gaining a lot of attention from use of stem cells in cell and tissue replacement therapeutics (Delcroix et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2009</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>; Heymer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>). There are several challenges in stem cell therapy; to overcome these difficulties, the bionanoparticles were widely used due to their biocompatibility nature. Thus, these bionanoparticles are highly essential in biomedicine and also for evaluating their potential toxicity (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>). The nanoparticles are very minute in nature, because of their tiny nature more than 10 millions of them are ingested by each and every human being daily and they easily circulate through the body (Nel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). As of now very little data are available on cytotoxic studies of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles on stem cells. The cytotoxicity depends upon concentration of nanoparticles (Braydich-Stolle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>). Thus, the present work was carried out to study the cytotoxicity of green synthesized silver nanoparticles at different concentrations on human CD34 +ve stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis of silver nanoparticles</title><p>The <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> root powder (Fig. S. see Supplementary data) was collected from Sri Venkateswara Ayurveda College of Pharmacy, Srinivasa mangapuram, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India. The root extract was prepared, by taking 1&#x000a0;g of finely powdered roots with 100&#x000a0;ml of sterile Milli-Q water in a sterile 250&#x000a0;ml conical flask and mixed thoroughly; the mixture was heated at 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min. After 10&#x000a0;min the sample was filtered through sterile muslin cloth followed by Whatman no.1 filter paper. The filtrate of the extract was used to carry out the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. To 1&#x000a0;ml of root extract filtrate, 4&#x000a0;ml of sterile Milli-Q water and 10&#x000a0;ml of 0.025 (M) AgNO<sub>3</sub> were added and left at room temperature and the reaction was observed. The colorless root extract was reduced by AgNO<sub>3</sub> and the color of the solution changed to yellow to dark brown (see Fig. S.1. in Supplementary data). The color change indicated the reduction of silver ions into AgNPs. The earlier studies also reveal that AgNPs exhibit a dark brown color in aqueous solution due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In the present study, the AgNPs were synthesized by <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> root extract without any toxic chemicals. Thus, this method is known as eco-friendly, environmental safe &#x0201c;Green method&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Spectral characterization</title><p>The biosynthesized AgNPs with the root extract of <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> were analyzed using Nanodrop (UV&#x02013;Visible spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific).

FT-IR analysis was carried out by Alpha T model, FT-IR spectrophotometer, Bruker Company. The synthesized AgNPs were carefully prepared by centrifuging at 9000&#x000a0;rpm for 20&#x000a0;min and the pellet was washed thoroughly with sterile Milli-Q distilled water thrice to remove the unbound plant extract residues. The isolated AgNPs were used for IR analysis. The particle size analysis and Zeta potential measurement experiments were carried out by Horiba SZ-100 nanoparticle analyzer. The particle size was performed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) of nanoparticles present in the solution, and the charge on the surface of the AgNPs was also measured by SZ-100. Further, the size and morphology of the synthesized AgNPs were also done by atomic force microscope (AFM-Solver Next, NT-MDT, Russia). The AFM analysis was carried out by coating a thin film of AgNPs on a sterile clean glass cover slip and it was air-dried prior to the analysis. The shape and size of the AgNPs were also determined by using transmission electron microscopy studies (TEM-FEI Tecnai F12, Philips Electron Optics, Holland) operated at 100&#x000a0;kV. The sizes of the synthesized silver nanoparticles were determined by using SIS imaging software (Munster, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The institutional ethical committee has cleared in vitro differentiation studies on human CD34<sup>+</sup> stem cells (Sarma and Subramanyam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>).

<bold>(</bold>Licorice), the most important approved herb after ginseng in China, is used for ailments related to spleen, liver and kidney, and the Japanese use the herb as an antiviral agent. The underground unpeeled or peeled stems or roots are used for the treatment. Licorice is widely used in polyherbal formulations and most of them have been evaluated during clinical studies (Dhanaukar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2000</xref>). Liquorice has Glycyrrhizin as the major water-soluble constituent responsible for its sweet taste. Glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin that is present within range 2&#x02013;14&#x000a0;%. Phytochemicals present in liquorice are flavanones, chalcones, isoflavones, glycyrrhizoflavonone, licoisoflavanone (isoflavanones), glycocoumnarins, lipocoumarins, glycyrin, and isoglycryol. <italic>G. glabra</italic> is used in folk medicine as a laxative, contraceptive, galactagogue, anti-asthmatic drug and antiviral agent. Due to the vast range of biological effects like anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antioxidant, antiviral of the phytochemicals present in extracts has been of immense importance in phytotherapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>UV&#x02013;Visible analysis</title><p>The green synthesized AgNPs were measured using UV&#x02013;Visible Nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer from 220&#x000a0;nm to 750&#x000a0;nm wavelength range, and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectra of AgNPs were obtained at 445&#x000a0;nm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The SPR was due to the presence of free electrons present on AgNPs, and it also plays a vital role on the size of the synthesized nanoparticles (Mock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>) Previous reports reveal that the nanoparticles having SPR range between 390 and 420&#x000a0;nm have been reported to have small nanoparticles, i.e., AgNPs around 25&#x000a0;nm -50&#x000a0;nm in size (Panacek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>) and also particles having SPR around 450&#x000a0;nm and above have variable size of AgNPs from 2 to 100&#x000a0;nm and above (Vijayaraghavan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2012</xref>). The AgNPs are spherical in shape, which are reported have the SPR around 410&#x02013;450&#x000a0;nm (Sivalingam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>; Mock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>; Zaheer and Rafiuddin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2012</xref>), moreover longer the wavelength, the size of nanoparticles is increased, shorter the wavelength, smaller the size of the AgNPs (Kannan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>). The SPR of biosynthesized AgNPs by root extract is around 445&#x000a0;nm, so with the result we can assume that the synthesized nanoparticles are spherical in shape and may be in the range of 25&#x000a0;nm&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10 to 100&#x000a0;nm&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;nm in range.

After the synthesis of AgNPs they are purified by centrifuging at 9000&#x000a0;rpm for 20&#x000a0;min and the pellet of AgNPs was collected. The centrifugation step was repeated thrice by washing the pellet with sterile distilled water to remove the any unbound residues of the plant root extract of <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>. The purified AgNPs are now used for IR analysis. The IR results reveals that the spectra of root extract and the AgNPs have more similarities, confirming that the plant root extract components like flavonoids and poly phenols are involved in the bioreduction and formation of AgNPs. The IR spectrum reveals that there are some marginal shifts in the peak positions of AgNPs, which is due bioreduction. Further the FT-IR data was analyzed to distinguish the possible bio-reducing biomolecules present in the plant root extract. The FT-IR spectra of root extract Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a reveals strong spectral peaks at 3744, 3425, 2923, 2854 and 2311&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 1634, 1550 and 1457&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 1383, 1161 and 1046&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of different functional peaks.

The peaks at 2923 and 2922&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> corresponds to asymmetric stretching of C&#x02013;H group and the other peaks corresponding to 1634 and 1624&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were identified as the characteristic peaks for the C&#x02013;H, C&#x02013;C, C&#x02013;O stretching and the amide I group due to the carbonyl vibrational stretches in amide group linkages in proteins. The peaks at 1383 and 1344&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> bands corresponds to C&#x02013;N stretching of aromatic amines and finally the intense peaks at 1046 and 1043&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are the bands corresponding to characteristic peaks of C&#x02013;OH stretching of secondary alcohols, carboxylic acids, ester and ether groups.(Shameli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>; Kora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). It is already known that the noble metal nanoparticles have useful functional groups on the surface to form a protective layer and gives stability to the nanoparticles. The functional groups such as amino (&#x02013;NH), carboxylic acid (COOH), mercapto (SH) and cyano (CN) and other groups have been proved to have high affinity towards metal nanoparticles (Teranishi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1998</xref>; Corbierre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>; Mandal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2002</xref>; Shan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2003</xref>). In the present study we identified that different functional groups such as &#x02013;NH, OH, C&#x02013;H, C&#x02013;C, C&#x02013;O have been actively participated in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using the root extract of <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>. <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> has Glycyrrhizin as the major water-soluble constituent. Glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin that is present within range of 2&#x02013;14&#x000a0;%. So the water soluble Glycyrrhizin and other bioactive components may have actively participated in synthesis of AgNPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>XRD analysis</title><p>X-ray diffraction studies of biosynthesized AgNPs was carried out to understand the crystalline nature of the particles. The XRD pattern of synthesized AgNPs in shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, it reveals three distinct reflections in the diffractogram at at 23.83&#x000b0; (111), 44.14&#x000b0; (311), and 51.15&#x000b0; (422), respectively, which indicates that the particles are crystalline in nature with face central cubic structure. And it is also concluded that there are no additional reflections other than Ag lattice, thus indicates that the AgNPs are very stable and are not affected by any other molecules present in the root extract (Philip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>XRD spectral data of synthesized silver nanoparticles</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_532_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

It is evident that the AgNPs are poly dispersed in nature due its high negative zeta potential thus the electrostatic repulsive force between them results in the prevention of agglomeration of the nanoparticles and also very much helpful for long term stability in the solution (Suresh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Zeta potential of synthesized AgNPs</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_532_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig>

The biosynthesized AgNPs were coated as a thin film on a piece of thick aluminum foil and analysis was carried out using AFM by tapping mode.

<italic>G. glabra</italic> root extract is found to be exceptionally suitable for rapid synthesis of silver nanoparticles by toxic free green method within 5 to 10&#x000a0;min. Further the AgNPs are characterized by different spectroscopic methods like UV&#x02013;Vis, FT-IR, XRD, particle size and Zeta potential, TEM and AFM analysis and also SEM analysis of the stem cells of the present study. From the above results it is clearly understood that the AgNPs are highly stable and polydispersed in nature with an average size of 41.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5 to 45.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;nm. The synthesized AgNPs are less than 50&#x000a0;nm in size due to their small size the AgNPs can be useful in various biomedical applications. The nanoparticles have high surface-to-volume ratio due to their physical and chemical properties; thus they are easily tailorable, multi-functional and have high solubility (Azzazy and Mansour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>). The cytotoxic effects of different types of metallic nanoparticles on stem cells have been studied by earlier by scientists and researchers. When cadmium oxide nanoparticles were added to stem cells germ lines at the concentration of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, the stem cell growth was inhibited by cell shrinkage, thus the cells become irregular in shape and mitochondrial dysfunction occurs. But when the concentration of nanoparticles increased to 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, the stem cells showed drastic changes, cells become necrotic and they are detached from the cultured dishes (Braydich-Stolle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>). Whereas when human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells treated with mesoporous silica nanoparticles conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate, do not show any toxicity, the stem cells are viable and highly proliferate (Chung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>). Similarly other studies with super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles reveal that the stem cells have a high percentage of survival rate of 91&#x02013;99&#x000a0;%, indicating that the iron oxide nanoparticles do not affect stem cell viability (Delcroix et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2009</xref>; Heymer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>; Jing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2009</xref>). The cytotoxicity of nanoparticles on stem cells depends on the type of nanoparticles. Whereas in the present study, the biosynthsised AgNPs by green route using <italic>G. glabra</italic> root extract do not show any cytotoxic effect on human CD34 +ve stem cells. The human CD34 +ve stem cells are proliferated very efficiently. So we hereby report for the first time the synthesis of silver bionanoparticles which do not show any cytotoxicity on stem cells. The whole study is illustrated in a schematic diagram which is Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;10</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous extract of the <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> plant roots</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_532_Fig10_HTML" id="MO10"/></fig>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles are smaller than 50&#x000a0;nm which can play a very important role in biomedical applications. So the human CD34 +ve stem cells grown on silver nanoparticles can be useful to treat chronic diseases and are much useful in regenerative medicine for repairing the tired and failing organ systems. Hence, the biosynthesised nanoparticles by using <italic>G. glabra</italic> root extract can play a very important role in regenerative medicine and clinical therapies like wound healing and in vitro growing of organs and tissues for various chronic diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
