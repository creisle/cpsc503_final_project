Ten bacterial strains with biodegradation potential were isolated from UEO-contaminated soil sample using enrichment technique. Two strains which exhibited the highest degradation %, 51&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.2 and 48&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.5, respectively, were selected. Based on the morphological, biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA sequence analysis, they were identified as <italic>Ochrobactrum anthropi</italic> HM-1 (accession no: KR360745) and <italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic> HM-2 (accession no: KR360746). The different conditions which may influence their biodegradation activity, including UEO concentration (1&#x02013;6&#x000a0;%, v/v), inoculum size (0.5&#x02013;4&#x000a0;%, v/v), initial pH (6&#x02013;8), incubation temperature (25&#x02013;45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), and rotation speed (0&#x02013;200&#x000a0;rpm), were evaluated. The optimum conditions were found to be 2&#x000a0;% UEO, 2&#x000a0;% inoculum size, pH 7.5, incubation temperature 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and 150&#x000a0;rpm. Under the optimized conditions, strains HM-1, HM-2, and their mixture efficiently degraded UEO, they achieved 65&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.2, 58&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.1, and 80&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.9&#x000a0;%, respectively, after 21&#x000a0;days of incubation. Biodegradation of UEO was confirmed by employing gas chromatography analysis. Gamma radiation (1.5&#x000a0;kGy) enhanced the degradation efficiency of irradiated bacterial mixture (95&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.1&#x000a0;%) as compared to non-irradiated (79&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.6&#x000a0;%). Therefore, strains HM-1 and HM-2 can be employed to develop a cost-effective method for bioremediation of used engine-oil-polluted soil.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Used engine oil</kwd><kwd>Biodegradation</kwd><kwd><italic>Ochrobactrum anthropi</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pollution due to petroleum hydrocarbons and its derivatives, including diesel fuel, gasoline, heavy oil, motor oil, fuel residues, and mineral oil, has an increasing influence on the environmental reconquest (Su et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>). They have been recognized as one of the most hazardous wastes (Udeani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>). Motor oil is a mixture of base lubricant oil and additives, and the base oil contains long-chain (C<sub>16</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>36</sub>) saturated hydrocarbons and more than 75&#x000a0;% cyclic alkanes (Koma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>). One billion gallons of waste lubricating oil (also called spent oil) are generated during oil-changing processes from automobile and mechanical workshops, a few of this huge amount is recycled, and most is disposed off by incineration or dumping. Therefore, there is a need to appropriate recycling to avoid their dangerous threat towards the environment (Kalyani and Pandey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>). Used motor oil contains more metals, toxic, and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Thus, it constitutes a potential threat to humans, animals, and vegetation (Adelowo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>). Treatment of contaminated soil and water resources takes place using mechanical methods, such as skimming and chemical methods, such as surfactants and dispersants; nevertheless, these methods are costly and with limited efficiency (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). In contrast, the utilization of microorganisms to degrade such pollutant has been found to be a promising alternative (Akio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). Microorganisms have potential to detoxify hazardous organic compounds by means of polymerization, mineralization, or transformation (Sarma and Sarma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>). Therefore, as compared to other technologies, microbial degradation (bioremediation) is the method of choice, because it is cost-effective, safe, and environmentally accepted (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>). Bioremediation process depends on the ability of microorganisms to remove the hydrocarbon pollutants completely (G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>). Interestingly, numerous hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms are capable of producing biosurfactants/emulsifiers agents that could increase the solubility of these sparingly or insoluble substrates and facilitate their utilization as sole carbon sources (Franzetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>; Su et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>).</p><p>Several reports have been established on biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons of used engine-oil-contaminated soils. Husaini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>) had successfully demonstrated the ability of 18 indigenous fungal isolates, isolated from local motor-oil-contaminated areas that were capable of degrading the aliphatic hydrocarbons. <italic>Penicillium</italic> species (P1) completely degrades the <italic>n</italic>-alkanes in the used motor oil after 2&#x000a0;months of incubation. Su et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>) demonstrated the motor-oil-degrading potential of an indigenous <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> SU-1 bacterial strain. This bacterium was found to have the ability to degrade motor oil efficiently upon growing in a medium containing such pollutant as the sole carbon source. Bhattacharya et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>) reported that a newly isolated <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> sp. C1 could grow with waste lubricants, as the sole carbon and energy source and degrade a wide range of hydrocarbons present in this waste efficiently. Larik et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>) reported the biodegradation of used engine oil and diesel oil using an efficient bacterial consortium A2457: encompassing <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, <italic>Bacillus pumilus</italic>, and <italic>B. cereus</italic>. Salam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) in his study established the extensive degradation ability of two <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strains RM1 and SK1 on waste engine oil. He reported the potentials of these strains in the degradation of aromatic, aliphatic, and branched alkane components of waste engine oils. Microbial consortiums have been usually suggested for complete biodegradation of petroleum pollutants (Farahat and El-Gendy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>), since the constituents of hydrocarbon mixtures differ in their solubility, volatility, and susceptibility to biodegradation, and in contrast, the required sets of enzymes cannot be present in a single microbial strain.</p><p>To treat contaminated areas, it is important to employ microorganisms which are indigenous to the contaminated sites and provide excellent degradation potential. Therefore, this work aims to isolate, identify, and characterize native used engine oil utilizing bacterial strains, from UEO-contaminated soil samples, and to estimate the biodegradation potential of the most promising strains, both individually and in combination. In addition, the factors which influence the biodegradation potential of such pollutant were investigated. In an attempt to enhance the biodegradation efficiency of these strains, the effect of gamma radiation was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Collection of soil samples</title><p>Three soil samples (each of 100&#x000a0;g), from locations that had heavy spillage of used engine oil, were collected in sterile polyethylene bags; from a depth of 15&#x000a0;cm, after removing the surface layer.

Later, 2&#x000a0;mL inoculum was transferred to a fresh MSM and incubated for another cycle. After three successive transfers, 1&#x000a0;mL of the culture was serially diluted in sterile saline solution (9&#x000a0;% NaCl). A 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the appropriate dilutions were plated onto sterile MSM agar plates previously sprayed with a UEO solution (2&#x000a0;g/20&#x000a0;mL in dichloromethane) and left uncovered in laminar air flow until the solvent has evaporated. The plates were incubated at 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and the developed bacterial colonies were selected based on their ability to grow and utilize UEO as sole carbon and energy source. Pure colonies on nutrient agar slants were properly labeled, preserved at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and subcultured at 4&#x000a0;week interval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Oil degradation potential of selected isolates</title><p>A single colony of each selected isolate was inoculated into 25&#x000a0;mL nutrient broth medium (Oxoid) in 250-mL flask, and incubated in a shaker incubator (Gallen Kamp, UK) at 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 150&#x000a0;rpm for 18&#x000a0;h.

One millilitre of the bacterial suspensions was used as an inoculum; to obtain standard inocula, the optical density (O.D<sub>660</sub>) was fixed to 0.5 (Ghazali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>) using UV&#x02013;Vis spectrophotometer (Helios Gamma, Thermo Corporation, England), and uninoculated MSM was used as a blank to adjust the spectrophotometer reading to zero. To determine the biodegradation potential, 2&#x000a0;mL of each bacterial suspension was inoculated into MSM (100&#x000a0;mL), supplemented with UEO (2&#x000a0;%, v/v), and incubated as aforementioned for 15&#x000a0;days. The UEO was sterilized separately by filtration. Control experiments (without bacterial biomass and with inactivated biomass by sterilization to assess the adsorption phenomena of substrate to the bacteria) were run simultaneously to assess the abiotic degradation of UEO. Thus, the values of the abiotic controls were subtracted from biotic degradation efficiencies, to report only the degradation caused by living bacterial cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Analytical methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Evaluation of bacterial growth</title><p>The bacterial growth was evaluated by measuring the optical density (O.D<sub>660</sub>) using UV&#x02013;Vis spectrophotometer (Helios Gamma, Thermo Corporation, England).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) determination</title><p>TPH were determined spectrophotometrically based on the method of Darvishi et al.

At higher UEO concentration (4 and 6&#x000a0;%), the degradation percentage decreased significantly, and this decrease could be ascribed to the toxicity of UEO at such concentrations, which might have negative effects on the biodegradation activities of the tested bacterial strains (Abioye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>).

In contrast, no significant reduction in oil concentration was observed for all controls, as pointed out in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. It has been reported that the low inoculum size requires a longer time for cells to multiply and to produce the desired effect (Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1998</xref>). Similarly, Abusham et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>) mentioned that the small inoculum size can lead to an insufficient number of bacterial cells and a reduced amount of the secreted enzymes, while higher inoculum size could lead to a lack of oxygen and depletion of nutrients in the growth media.</p><p>As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, the utilization of UEO was slower when the initial medium pH was acidic (pH 6) as revealed by the low degradation percentage. In contrast, the maximum rate of biodegradation process was achieved when the pH was neutral or slightly alkaline. The highest degradation percentage was observed at pH 7.5, at which <italic>O. anthropi</italic> HM-1, <italic>C. freundii</italic> HM-2, and their mixture attained degradation percentage of 60&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.1, 53&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.1, and 70&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.2&#x000a0;%, respectively. Further increase in medium pH to 8 led to a remarkable decrease in biodegrading percentage, which may be attributed to the reduced bacterial activity. Only marginal abiotic loss (3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.2 to 5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.5&#x000a0;%) was observed in the control flasks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).

As indicated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, the rate of UEO degradation process was maximum at incubation temperature of 30 and 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C; nevertheless, the most favourable temperature for biodegradation was 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, at which 65&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.6, 58&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.8, and 76&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.7&#x000a0;% degradation were achieved by strains HM-1, HM-2, and their mixture, respectively. A noticeable decreasing trend was observed with the further elevation of incubation temperature to 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Nominal percentage loss of waste oil was observed for all controls (2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.3 to 5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.9&#x000a0;%). In agreement, Aleer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>) also found that the optimum temperature for waste engine oil biodegradation by a microbial consortium was 30&#x02013;37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The variation in the agitation speed affects the degree of mixing and the nutrient availability in the shake flasks or the bioreactor (Abusham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>). The degradation activity of strains HM-1, HM-2 and their mixture gradually increased and reached the maximum value at rotation speed 150&#x000a0;rpm, at which they exhibited degradation percentage of 61&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.6, 56&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.1, and 77&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.5&#x000a0;%, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). The degradation rate did not reveal any increasing tendency with the further increase of rotate speed to 200&#x000a0;rpm. Therefore, the optimal rotation speed is 150&#x000a0;rpm, which guarantees to maintain a sufficient supply of dissolved oxygen in the medium for the bacterial strains to grow and degrade the UEO. In agreement, Deng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>) found that the degradation rate of diesel oil using strain <italic>Achromobacter</italic> sp.

These results suggested that strains HM-1 and HM-2 could co-exist with no adverse effect and possibly have a synergy, which may be responsible for the high degradation percentage observed in this study. The advantages of employing mixed cultures have been manifested (Akoachere et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>). Ghazali et al.

Then, it is possible that the other species degrade complex compounds totally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Time course of UEO biodegradation</title><p>Under the optimum conditions, namely, UEO 2&#x000a0;% (v/v), pH 7.5, inoculum size 2&#x000a0;% (v/v), incubation temperature 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and 150&#x000a0;rpm, the growth along with degradation rate of UEO by strains HM-1, HM-2, and their mixture were investigated over 21&#x000a0;days incubation period. As illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, the bacterial strains started utilization of UEO as sole energy and carbon sources, since the initial 3&#x000a0;days interval. The growth (O.D<sub>660</sub>) increased rapidly by extending the incubation time, and strain HM-1 attained maximum growth after 15&#x000a0;days (max.

In contrast, the bacterial mixture continued to grow and utilize UEO until the end of incubation time, the maximum O.D<sub>660</sub> was 1.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.08. Similarly, the two bacterial strains along with their mixture started degradation of UEO, since the initial 3&#x000a0;days interval (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), and the degradation rate increased with time until reached maximum at the end of incubation period (21&#x000a0;days); 65&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.2, 58&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.1, and 80&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.9&#x000a0;% degradations were attained by strains HM-1, HM-2, and the mixture, respectively.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>) reported a significant degradation of the used engine oil (99.77&#x000a0;%) by the consortium A2457 when grown in MSM amended with UEO at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 28&#x000a0;days in shaking incubator. Bhattacharya et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>) reported an increase in the percentage degradation from 48.35 to 63.5&#x000a0;% for waste engine oil and from 30.74 to 41.5&#x000a0;% for waste transformer oil on increasing the incubation period up to 21&#x000a0;days. Other researchers (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>; Abioye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>) also found that total petroleum hydrocarbon levels could be significantly reduced by increasing the incubation period during treatment of waste oil-contaminated soil.</p><p>The GC chromatograms of residual UEO extracted from abiotic control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), MSM medium inoculated with strain HM-1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b), strain HM-2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c), and their mixture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d) exhibited total peak area of, 100,846, 56,307, 75,598, and 50,369, respectively. Thereby, the percentage of total peak area disappeared upon treatments was 44.17, 25.04, and 50.05&#x000a0;%, respectively, as compared to the control. These results confirmed the UEO biodegradation potential of these strains. Besides, the mixture was more efficient than the pure individual cultures. The TPHs were determined in instead of individual petroleum components due to the fact that used engine oil has extremely variable composition and altered structure according to the degree of combustion process during its functioning (Adesodum and Mbagwu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>GC chromatograms of residual UEO in MSM after incubation for 21&#x000a0;days at optimum conditions.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Influence of gamma irradiation</title><p>As pointed out in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, gamma irradiation enhanced the biodegradation potential of bacterial mixture. The highest biodegradation level (95&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.1&#x000a0;%) was achieved at dose 1.5&#x000a0;kGy as compared to the non-irradiated mixture (79&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.6&#x000a0;%). In contrast, 75, 80, 79, 80, and 81&#x000a0;% were attained at 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, and 3&#x000a0;kGy, respectively. It is speculated that the improved activity of the irradiated cells may be attributed to the changes occurred at the genetic level, i.e., a mutation in the gene(s) that encode for the enzymes involved in the biodegradation process or the enhancement in biosurfactant/bioemulsifier production which in turn increase the availability of used engine oil. Physical mutagenesis employing different irradiation methods has been adopted as one of many strategies to mutate bacteria. There are many examples concerning the potential efficiency of physical mutagenesis, such as UV and gamma irradiations to enhance the production of different biocatalysts. A gamma-ray-induced mutant of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strain S8 was isolated and designated as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> EBN-8. This mutant revealed 3&#x02013;4 times more crude oil biodegradation and emulsification when grown on Khaskheli crude oil in minimal medium as compared to the parent strain (Iqbal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1995</xref>). Similarly, an improved biodegradation of crude oil in aqueous phase was achieved utilizing the mutant <italic>Dietzia</italic> sp. obtained by random mutagenesis of parent <italic>Dietzia</italic> sp. employing <sup>60</sup>Co gamma irradiation. A genetically stable mutant, designated as M22, was isolated and approved significantly higher degradation percentage (52.5&#x000a0;%) of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) than the wild strain (28.2&#x000a0;%) in liquid media after incubation for 14&#x000a0;days. This enhancement was ascribed to increase production of enzymes responsible for the degradation by the mutant strain (Duan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Effect of gamma irradiation on the biodegradation efficiency of <italic>O. anthropi</italic> HM-1 and <italic>C. freundii</italic> HM-2 mixture under optimum conditions. <italic>Error bars</italic> represent SD values of three independent experiments (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2016_540_Fig6_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated the potential of native bacterial consortium encompasses <italic>O. anthropi</italic> HM-1 and <italic>C. freundii</italic> HM-2 for bioremediation of UEO-contaminated soil. Each individual strain in the co-culture has a significant role and may be dependent on the presence of the other strain for surviving and biodegradation. The mixture demonstrated higher degradation efficiency of UEO than the individual cultures, possibly due to the synergy effect. Gamma irradiation significantly enhanced the biodegradation potential of the co-culture. Therefore, strains HM-1 and HM-2 can be employed to develop a cost-effective and eco-friendly method for the bioremediation of used engine-oil-polluted soil.</p></sec></body><back><notes
