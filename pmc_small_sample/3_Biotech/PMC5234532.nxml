Its main antimicrobial components, M1 and S1 factors, act synergistically if the M1:S1 ratio in the final product is 70&#x02013;75:25&#x02013;30. This fact significantly complicates the development of stable high-yield strains suitable for industrial application. In the previous work, authors obtained a mutant <italic>S. virginiae</italic> VKM Ac-2738D strain, characterized by a high productivity in flasks and the optimum M1:S1 ratio (75:25) in the final product. In this study, the scale-up of the virginiamycin production by VKM AC-2738D from shake flasks to a pilot-scale (100&#x000a0;L) stirred fermentor was carried out and the possibility of the in situ use of synthetic adsorbing resins to remove virginiamycin from culture broth was assessed. After the optimization of pH and dissolved oxygen concentration (6.8&#x02013;7.0 and 50%, respectively), the fed-batch fermentation of VKM Ac-2738D with continuous addition of 50% sucrose solution (5&#x000a0;g/L/day starting from 48&#x000a0;h of fermentation) resulted in a final virginiamycin titer of 4.9&#x000a0;g/L. Among four tested resins, Diaion<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HP21 added to fermentation medium prior to sterilization absorbed 98.5% of the total virginiamycin that simplifies its further recovery procedure and increased its total titer to 5.6&#x000a0;g/L at the M1:S1 ratio of 74:26. The developed technology has several important advantages, which include (1) the optimum M1:S1 ratio in the final product, (2) the possibility to use sucrose as a carbon source instead of traditionally used and more expensive glucose or <sc>d</sc>-maltose, and (3) selective binding of up to 98.5% of produced virginiamycin on the adsorbing resin.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Streptomyces virginiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Virginiamycin</kwd><kwd>Fed-batch fermentation</kwd><kwd>Scale-up</kwd><kwd>Dissolved oxygen</kwd><kwd>Synthetic resins</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003443</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14.579.21.0106</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Virginiamycin, an antibiotic produced by <italic>Streptomyces virginiae</italic>, belongs to the streptogramin group and represents a natural mix of two synergistic factors, M (hybrid polyketide-peptide) and S (peptide). The main antimicrobial components of the antibiotic are the M1 and S1 factors. One of the unique features of the virginiamycin biosynthesis is a simultaneous production of both M1 and S1 at a ratio providing their maximum synergistic activity in the suppression of the protein biosynthesis in susceptible microorganisms (Di Giambattista et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1989</xref>). The maximum synergism is observed when M1 and S1 are present in the optimum ratio of 70&#x02013;75:25&#x02013;30; in this case, the total antimicrobial activity of virginiamycin increases 3.5&#x02013;4 times (Mast and Wohlleben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). There is also another point of view based on the study of antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin, another antibiotic of the virginiamycin group, at different ratios of its components (Jamjian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1997</xref>). This study showed no significant difference between various quinupristin/dalfopristin ratios. Nevertheless, there were no similar studies concerning virginiamycin, i.e., the idea of the best synergistic ratio of its components still has not been disproved.</p><p>Virginiamycin M1 and S1 alone exhibit bacteriostatic activity, but their synergic combination possesses bactericidal activity (Mast and Wohlleben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). In addition, virginiamycin can be used as a growth stimulator, since it optimizes the absorption and metabolism of nutrients, improves the state of small intestine epithelium, and inhibits the synthesis of harmful toxins and metabolites by gut organisms (Feighner and Dashkevicz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1987</xref>; Cervantes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>).</p><p>Virginiamycin is actively used for the industrial production of ethanol fuel (Hynes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1997</xref>; Arshad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>); in addition, some countries, including USA, Russia, Brazil, and China, allow its use as an antibiotic feed additive for cattle and poultry (Hofacre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>; Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2008</xref>; Shojadoost et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). By 2020, the predicted increase in the consumption of this antibiotic in North America, Europe, and Asia will be 6% (Chem-Report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>).</p><p>To produce a sufficient volume of virginiamycin, the development of high-yield industrial <italic>S. virginiae</italic> strains and improved technologies for their cultivation are required. However, the biosynthesis of virginiamycin components is controlled by a lot of different regulators (Pulsawat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>), and its antibiotic efficiency depends on the correct M1:S1 ratio, so the development of stable overproducing strains seems to be an extremely difficult task. An indirect evidence of this fact is a very small number of publications on the strain improvement of <italic>S. virginiae</italic>. The productivity of strains reported in various publications is relatively low and varies from 0.28 to 1.9&#x000a0;g/L (Biot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1984</xref>; Prikrylova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1987</xref>; Zvenigorodskii et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>; Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>). An additional increase of the strain productivity can be achieved by medium improvement and optimization of fermentation conditions, but even in this case the productivity of the existing industrial strains remains mainly within the range 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;g/L (Biot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1984</xref>; Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Han et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). Thus, the problem of the development of overproducing <italic>S. virginiae</italic> strains and technologies for the industrial biosynthesis of virginiamycin is still relevant.</p><p>In our previous study, a high-yield <italic>S. virginiae</italic> strain, characterized by the basic productivity of about 2.6&#x000a0;g/L and the optimal M1:S1 ratio in the final product, has been obtained by induced UV mutagenesis from the VKPM Ac-790 strain, whose productivity was only 0.6&#x000a0;g/L (Dzhavakhiya et al., unpublished manuscript). After the completion of the strain identification and the study of its biochemical and physiological properties, the strain was deposited at the All-Russian Collection of Microorganisms (Skryabin Institute of Biochemistry and Physiology of Microorganisms, Pushchino, Russia) under the accession no. VKM Ac-2738D.</p><p>After the medium improvement, the productivity of new strain in flasks reached 4.3&#x000a0;g/L, while the M1:S1 ratio remained synergistic (75:25). One should note that the majority of publications and patents describing the development of virginiamycin-producing strains do not contain information on the determination of this ratio in the synthesized product. At the same time, possible violation of the synergistic M1:S1 ratio during the virginiamycin biosynthesis may result in the necessity of additional technological stages intended to either correct this ratio, or to separate M1 and S1 components during the isolation and purification process for their further mixing in the required proportion in the final formulation. Therefore, the VKM Ac-2738D strain has an additional advantage that increases its value for the industrial production of virginiamycin.</p><p>An increased productivity of industrial antibiotic-producing strains often results in a self-inhibiting effect of their metabolites able to suppress not only their own biosynthesis, but also the growth and development of a microorganism. One of the ways to reduce possible cytotoxicity and self-inhibition effects of accumulated target product is fermentation in the presence of adsorbing resins able to selectively remove the product from the culture broth (Phillips et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). However, this method requires the selection of a certain resin type for each metabolite, since even resins with similar characteristics can provide opposite results, either increasing, or reducing the content of a target product in culture broth (Lam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1995</xref>; Warr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>). A correct adsorbent selection can provide a very significant (sometimes 100-fold) yield increase (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). In spite of a large number of publications describing the use of adsorbing resins in the microbial production of biologically active substances, we did not find any information on the use of such resins in the virginiamycin production, though the use of adsorbing resins was reported to increase the production of a similar antibiotic, pristinamycin, by 1.25&#x02013;1.55 times (Jia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2006</xref>, Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this study was the scale-up of the virginiamycin production by <italic>S. virginiae</italic> VKM Ac-2738D from shake flasks to a pilot-scale (100&#x000a0;L) stirred fermentor and the assessment of the possibility of in situ use of synthetic adsorbing resins to bind produced virginiamycin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Virginiamycin-producing microorganism and media composition</title><p>The <italic>S. virginiae</italic> VKM Ac-2738D strain obtained from the known VKPM Ac-790 strain by a multi-step UV mutagenesis and deposited at the All-Russian Collection of Microorganisms was used as a virginiamycin producer.

Air supply was maintained at the level of 0.5&#x000a0;L/L/min, the speed rate of the impeller was maintained at 250&#x000a0;rpm. During the first 36&#x000a0;h of fermentation, pH decreased from 7.1 to 6.4, and then increased reaching 8.3 at the end of the process (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At the 60th&#x000a0;hour of fermentation, crude biomass content in culture broth increased from 8.6 to 18.3% and then decreased to 15.7% that probably indicated cell lysis. This hypothesis was also confirmed by a pH increase up to 8.3 observed at 92&#x02013;96&#x000a0;h of fermentation: when carbon source is depleted and its concentration falls below the level required for the cell maintenance, it results in cell death and lysis followed by protein hydrolysis and corresponding liberation of ammonia that increases pH (Schaffner and Toledo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1991</xref>; Ting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>).

</p><p>Weak biomass accumulation indicated insufficient content of carbohydrates in fermentation medium and probable negative effect of increased pH on the virginiamycin biosynthesis. To check the hypothesis on the negative effect of increased pH on the biosynthesis of the target product and to determine the optimum pH value, a series of fermentations was carried out at different pH values within the range of 4&#x02013;9. The tested pH values were maintained by an automatic HCl supply via a peristaltic pump. Both control parameters were registered after 84&#x000a0;h of fermentation.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Productivity of <italic>Streptomyces virginiae</italic> VKM Ac-2738D under fed-batch fermentation conditions with controlled addition of sucrose</title><p>Metabolic changes in overproducing mutant strains often affect the possibility to utilize various nutrients. In addition, high-yield strains are sometimes characterized by more intensive growth, so they may need higher concentrations of nutrients, especially carbon sources (Zhdanova <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1989</xref>). Therefore, it is important to select the most efficient types and concentrations of these nutrients for each industrial strain to realize its productivity potential.</p><p>In the case of <italic>S. virginiae</italic>, the most available carbon sources are simple sugars, such as mono- and disaccharides. For example, it was shown that the optimal additional carbon source for <italic>S. virginiae</italic> ATCC 13161 was <sc>d</sc>-maltose, which doubled virginiamycin production (Zvenigorodskii et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>). In the same study, good results were also obtained for mannose and <sc>d</sc>-glucose (yield increase by 50% of the control), but the use of complex carbohydrates, such as starch resulted in a lower effect. Fructose and glucose were shown to be the best carbon sources for the <italic>S. virginiae</italic> HM3 strain (Rifaat and Kansoh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) and six other <italic>S. virginiae</italic> strains (Anzai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1994</xref>); in the last case, four strains were also able to utilize L-arabinose. Boeck et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1985</xref>) described the <italic>S. virginiae</italic> NRRL 15156 strain able to grow on cellobiose, fructose, galactose, glucose, maltose, ribose, salicin, and succinate.</p><p>One of distinctive features of VKM Ac-2738D was its ability to utilize sucrose as the carbon source, whereas the parental strain and all above-mentioned strains were not able to grow on sucrose. Comparing to other carbon sources tested, sucrose provided the maximum virginiamycin titer (3.27&#x000a0;g/L) and M1:S1 ratio of 72:28; a high productivity level was also observed for glucose and starch (3.15 and 2.95&#x000a0;g/L, respectively), but in both cases, the M1:S1 ratio was shifted to 55:45 and 59:41, respectively (Dzhavakhiya et al. unpublished manuscript). Therefore, sucrose was selected as the additional carbon source.</p><p>Rapidly metabolized simple sugars, including sucrose, are able to interfere with the biosynthesis of many antibiotics resulting in so-called carbon catabolite repression (Sanchez and Demain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2002</xref>). The possible solution of this problem is a fed-batch fermentation, since the concentration of the limiting substrate may be maintained at a very low level avoiding repressive effects of high substrate concentration and improving the final antibiotic yield (Callewaert and de Vuyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>; Elsayed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>). Taking into account this fact, a continuous addition of 50% sterile sucrose solution was provided after 48&#x000a0;h of fermentation under controlled optimal pH and DO concentration (6.8&#x02013;7.0 and 50%, respectively). The sucrose addition started in automatic mode when the pH value exceeded 6.8.</p><p>A continuous supply of 50% sucrose solution during the fermentation process provided additional pH stabilization due to the formation of organic acids during metabolic processes. This pH stabilization resulted in the prolongation of the active virginiamycin biosynthesis providing the final virginiamycin titer reaching 4.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.2&#x000a0;g/L (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The biomass content in culture broth reached maximum after 72&#x000a0;h of fermentation (25.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3%) and then slightly decreased to the end of fermentation (23.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.8%).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p>As we have mentioned earlier, a complex nature of virginiamycin significantly complicates the development of overproducing strains. The analysis of virginiamycin-related publications and patents showed that the problem of development of high-yield industrial strains able to synthesize both virginiamycin M1 and S1 in the desired synergistic ratio is still relevant, since the M1:S1 ratio in the final product can significantly change during strain improvement that can negatively influence on the antimicrobial activity of a target product. For example, in the course of a long-term program of extensive selection of <italic>S. virginiae</italic> performed by the Phibro Animal Health corporation (the main world manufacturer of virginiamycin-based formulations), the use of UV and chemical mutagenesis resulted in a wide range of mutant strains with different characteristics, including various deviations in the M1:S1 ratio or even completely blocked biosynthesis of one or both components (Lanoot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>). Since the vast majority of the mentioned publications do not contain information on the control of the M1:S1 ratio, the VKM Ac-2738D strain, which provides the optimum value of this parameter, seems to be especially valuable for the industrial production of virginiamycin.</p><p>As a rule, microbial biosynthesis technologies are first developed under laboratory conditions and then scaled-up in a pilot and then industrial scale. The main task of the scale-up process is to increase the volume of production while maintaining or even increasing the productivity of the used strain (Schmidt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2005</xref>). A successful scaling-up strongly depends on fermentation conditions. High cell density in fermenters significantly differs from their natural growth conditions and results in some stresses related to various environmental factors, such as changes in temperature, pH, osmotic concentrations, etc. (Mattanovich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>). Substrate and DO concentrations also influence on the cell growth and biosynthetic processes (Mattanovich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>; Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>).</p><p>The number of existing publications and patents related to the technologies of the industrial virginiamycin biosynthesis is relatively low. The majority of such publications are devoted to the optimization of the medium components, including carbon/nitrogen sources and minor elements (Zvenigorodskii et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>; Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Yong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>); some authors also describe the effect of addition of precursors (Han et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>) and regulators of the virginiamycin biosynthesis (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1995</xref>). The optimization of fermentation conditions is described only in several studies. One group of authors demonstrated the importance of the DO concentration and agitation rate control for the increase of a virginiamycin production by a low-yield <italic>S. virginiae</italic> MAFF 10-06014 (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1996</xref>; Shioya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1999</xref>). The optimization of these two parameters combined with the addition of the virginiae butanolide C (VB-C), which regulates biosynthesis of virginiamycin, provided an 18&#x000d7;&#x000a0;increase in the virginiamycin M1 production. Another group of authors described in their patent an increased virginiamycin production under conditions of fed-batch fermentation with continuous or intermittent addition of 1&#x02013;5% glucose and either mixture of amino acids, or their source (Nomura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1990</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we assessed the effect of such fermentation parameters as the medium pH, DO concentration, and continuous addition of 50% sucrose solution on the virginiamycin productivity of VKM Ac-2738D. The pH maintenance at the optimal level (6.8&#x02013;7.0) provided an antibiotic titer increase to 3.9&#x000a0;g/L (+11.4%), an additional DO control at a level of 50% improved it up to 4.2&#x000a0;g/L (+20%), and the fed-batch fermentation strategy using 50% sucrose solution resulted in the virginiamycin titer increase up to 4.9&#x000a0;g/L that was 40% higher than that under initial fermentation conditions (3.5&#x000a0;g/L).</p><p>In addition, we also evaluated the possibility of the use of synthetic adsorbing resins for selective binding of virginiamycin and reduction of a self-inhibition effect. In spite of a wide use of this approach in the microbial production of biologically active substances including pristinamycin, an antibiotic, which is very similar to virginiamycin (Jia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2006</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>), authors did not find any data for virginiamycin. The only known patent, mentioning the use of an unknown Dow macroporous resin in the virginiamycin biosynthesis, described the application of this resin as a tool to improve gas exchange in the fermentation medium (Yong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). According to this patent, the addition of a Dow resin and a surfactant combined with the performed medium optimization provided the virginiamycin titer exceeding 6&#x000a0;g/L; however, this information does not allow us to evaluate either relative productivity increase caused by the resin addition, or the M1:S1 ratio in the final product. At the same time, our study of several adsorbing resins showed a variability of this ratio depending on the resin type and revealed a sorbent, which use provided an increase of the virginiamycin titer up to 5.6&#x000a0;g/L; the M1:S1 ratio in the bound virginiamycin remained within the optimum range (74:26). Moreover, the Diaion<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HP21 resin, added to fermentation medium prior the sterilization, provided a selective binding of almost all virginiamycin from culture broth facilitating its further recovery.</p><p>The revealed difference in the final M1:S1 ratio depending on the resin type represents an interesting phenomenon that has not been described for the production of either virginiamycin, or any other similar antibiotic. Now authors do not have clear explanation of this fact. It may be caused by some steric factors providing different levels of adsorption of M1 and S1 components by different resins. Alternatively, since resins are added to the medium before fermentation, they can adsorb some nutrients or metabolites important for the biosynthesis of virginiamycin M1 or S1 components; the corresponding deficiency may result in the shift in the ratio of synthesized components. An additional study of this phenomenon it required.</p><p>Thus, we successfully scaled-up the technology of a virginiamycin production by high-yield <italic>S. virginiae</italic> VKM Ac-2738D from 50-ml shake flasks to a 100-L stirred fermenter and reproduced on a pilot-scale results obtained on a lab-scale. Different types of synthetic resins were first evaluated for their ability to reduce the self-inhibition effect and improve the virginiamycin titer in a lab-scale, and an optimal variant was successfully tested in a pilot-scale. The developed technology provides a final virginiamycin titer at the level of 5.6&#x000a0;g/L and has several additional advantages. First, VKM Ac-2738D produces virginiamycin M1 and S1 at the optimum ratio providing the maximum antimicrobial activity of a final product; the performed scale-up kept this important parameter unchanged. Second, VKM Ac-2738D is able to utilize sucrose, which represents less expensive carbon source than traditionally used glucose or <sc>d</sc>-maltose. Third, the used adsorbing resin, Diaion<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HP21, is able to selectively bind up to 98.5% of virginiamycin from culture broth that simplifies the further virginiamycin recovery procedure. The data obtained during this study provide some new information and can be used in other virginiamycin-related studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation within the framework of the Federal Targeted Program for Research and Development in Priority Areas of Advancement of the Russian Scientific and Technological Complex for 2014-2020 (Grant Agreement No. 14.579.21.0106 from 15.10.2015, code RFMEFI57915X0106).</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest in the publication.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anzai</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Okuda</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Application of the random amplified polymorphic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction for efficient elimination of duplicate strains in microbial screeningII.
