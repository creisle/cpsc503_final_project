<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains from sewage sample were screened for the presence and expression of heavy metal-translocating <italic>znt</italic>A gene by PCR and RT-PCR analysis with type culture of K-12 as standard strain.

The need for the development of efficient and economic ways for the degradation of these heavy metals is of top priority in the attempts to clean our environment. Use of microorganisms which have metal-resistant capacity in metal polluted areas reduces the metal bioavailability and helps in the bioremediation of the soils (Ji and Silver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1995</xref>). These microorganisms possess different types of metal-resistant mechanisms like intra- and extra-cellular metal sequestration, metal efflux pumps, metal reduction and production of metal cheaters (Nies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1999</xref>; Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>). In the post-genomic era, molecular biological approaches based on genome sequences help to study the different genes and proteins that play a role in the degradation of these heavy metals.</p><p id="Par3">

However, the discrete behavior of the individual genes/proteins under specific conditions, especially when zinc is present along with other heavy metals in the growth media is not studied.

At high zinc concentration, zntA, a P-type transporter of efflux system is upregulated (Rensing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1997</xref>; Outten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>).

The discrete function of each transporter/facilitator of the influx and efflux system is studied to some extent. Nevertheless, their functions under specific conditions, specifically when zinc is present along with high concentration of other heavy metals are largely unknown. Our study described here represents a step forward in this area of research demonstrating the translocation of zinc when it is present alone as well as in combination with lead in the growth environment of <italic>E. coli.</italic>
</p><p id="Par15">The sewage sample used in the study contained 2.90, 1.04, 0.08 and 0.50&#x000a0;mg/L of Hg, Zn, Pb and Cu, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were isolated and characterized based on cultural and biochemical methods as described. The strains were designated as SBVP1, SBVP2, SBVP3 and SBVP4. Primers for the amplification of <italic>znt</italic>A gene were designed based on the gene sequence of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 substr. MG1655. All the four strains from sewage sample as well as the K-12 type culture showed amplification of the <italic>znt</italic>A gene in PCR done with genomic DNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). However, RT-PCR with total RNA obtained from these strains showed expression of the gene in sewage-derived strains only (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Among these strains, SBVP1 which showed higher expression was chosen for further study and grown in varying concentrations (0&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mM) of Zn and Pb salts. ZnSO<sub>4</sub> of 3.5&#x000a0;mM and Pb(CH3COO)<sub>2</sub> of 4.0&#x000a0;mM were found to be the concentrations after which further increase in concentration resulted in reduced growth of bacteria. The strain SBVP1 was further grown in media containing the optimized concentrations of Zn and Pb salts separately as well as in combination. The results of growth of this strain in this experiment are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The growth was found to be slow but steady in media containing 3.5&#x000a0;mM ZnSO<sub>4</sub> until observed (144&#x000a0;h). In contrast, the growth of bacteria in Pb salt containing media was high initially but with further flat growth level as compared to steep raise in Zn containing media. When the heavy metal salts were used in combination, a similar flat growth rate was observed. The result of this experiment indicate that the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain although tolerates Zn by possible translocation, the growth is affected by the presence of Pb salt. To confirm these observations, Zn and Pb were estimated in the bacterial cell pellet extract and expressed as mM (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Cell pellet extract of SBPV1 contained 1.039&#x000a0;mM Zn in ZnSO<sub>4</sub> containing media compared to 0.308&#x000a0;mM in media containing Zn and Pb salts. The result of this estimation supports the observation made on growth of bacteria. Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>) proposed that the dramatic increase in intracellular free Zn is caused by sudden increase in Zn influx due to increased extracellular concentration coupled with lack of sufficient intracellular ligands to rapidly sequester and buffer all these excess zinc.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Analysis of heavy metals in sewage sample used in the study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Heavy metal</th><th align="left">Standard/sample</th><th align="left">Concentration (mg/L)</th><th align="left">Mean absorbance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2">Hg</td><td align="left">Standard Hg</td><td char="." align="char">15.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.0235</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sewage sample</td><td char="." align="char">2.900</td><td char="." align="char">0.0045</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2">Zn</td><td align="left">Standard Zn</td><td char="." align="char">15.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.9622</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sewage sample</td><td char="." align="char">1.038</td><td char="." align="char">0.0669</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2">Pb</td><td align="left">Standard Pb</td><td char="." align="char">15.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.0703</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sewage sample</td><td char="." align="char">0.080</td><td char="." align="char">0.0004</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2">Cu</td><td align="left">Standard Cu</td><td char="." align="char">15.00</td><td char="." align="char">0.3299</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sewage sample</td><td char="." align="char">0.502</td><td char="." align="char">0.0110</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>) employed genetically encoded fluorescent zinc sensor to monitor the intracellular free zinc changes and found increasing expression of <italic>znt</italic>A in a zinc-dependent manner.</p><p id="Par18">We also observed the increased expression of <italic>znt</italic>A in the presence of zinc at high concentration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) which correlated with high level of intracellular zinc in bacterial cells (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition, Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>) also observed prolonged accumulation of zinc in <italic>znt</italic>A mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> and they proposed <italic>zit</italic>B as constitutive first-line defense against toxic zinc influx and the upregulation of <italic>znt</italic>A is to lower the zinc concentration.</p><p id="Par19">In our study, we observed constitutive expression of <italic>znt</italic>A even during normal growth conditions in all the strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> from sewage sample excepting the K-12 type culture. Hence we propose that the presence of zinc in the environmental niche, from which the strains are collected, would have &#x02018;trained&#x02019; the <italic>znt</italic>A gene to express constitutively due to continuous exposure to zinc at least in less toxic levels (1.038&#x000a0;mg/L; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Further analysis of genes like <italic>znt</italic>R, the transcription factor which is known to be activated by zinc and which regulates <italic>znt</italic>A is expected to provide additional evidences towards the aforesaid proposal.</p><p id="Par20">Based on our study we conclude (1) <italic>znt</italic>A is a constitutively expressing gene playing major role in zinc translocation in environmental strains of <italic>E. coli</italic>; (2) higher intracellular accumulation due to zinc shock in growth environment is controlled by the presence of Pb in the same environment; (3) zinc-induced <italic>znt</italic>A gene plays additional role in translocating Pb, intracellularly.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully
