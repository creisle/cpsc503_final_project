Pyrene is a high-molecular weight PAH, which has human health concerns. In the present study, a bacterial consortium, PBR, was developed from a long-term polluted site, viz., Amlakhadi, Ankleshwar, Gujarat, for effective degradation of pyrene. The consortium effectively metabolized pyrene as a sole source of carbon and energy. The consortium comprised three bacterial species, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. ASDP1, <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp. ASDP2, and <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp. ASDP3. The maximum growth rate of consortium was 0.060/h and the maximum pyrene degradation rate was 16&#x000a0;mg/l/day. The organic and inorganic nutrients along with different surfactants did not affect pyrene degradation, but degradation rate moderately increased in the presence of sodium succinate. The significant characteristic of the consortium was that it possessed an ability to degrade six other hydrocarbons, both independently and simultaneously at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, in BHM (pH 7.0) under shaking conditions (150&#x000a0;rpm) and it showed resistance towards mercury at 10&#x000a0;mM concentration. Phthalic acid as one of the intermediates during pyrene degradation was detected through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The efficiency of consortium for pyrene degradation was validated in simulated microcosms&#x02019; study, which indicated that 99% of pyrene was metabolized by the consortium under ambient conditions.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13205-017-0598-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pyrene</kwd><kwd>Sodium succinate</kwd><kwd>Heavy metals</kwd><kwd>Phthalic acid</kwd><kwd>Bioremediation</kwd><kwd>Enrichment technique</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/01/CEIB/09/V/05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Madamwar</surname><given-names>Datta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous compounds present in the environment. Their origin in the environment may be attributed to extensive anthropogenic activities like industrialization, incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and oil spills or natural phenomena like wood fires, volcano eruptions and natural underwater oil spills <bold>(</bold>Juhasz and Naidu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2000</xref>; Atlas and Hazen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>). PAHs are considered as priority pollutants by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). They persist in the environment for a long time because of the sequestration in sediment particles&#x02019; micropores and thus remain out of reach of microbial degradation. They are also concerned with human health because many PAHs are mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic (Haritash and Kaushik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Pyrene is high-molecular weight (HMW) PAH having very high hydrophobicity and because of its high octanol:water partition coefficient, there are relatively less reports of efficient degradation of this compound by microorganisms, though many efforts have been made by several investigators. In addition, few studies have reported on the utilization of these compounds as a sole carbon source (Bacosa and Inoue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>; Ghosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>; Ho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2008</xref>). There are reports of degradation of pyrene by pure cultures and consortia developed from various origins like petroleum sludge, oil spill sites or other petroleum products contaminated sites. The isolated organisms may be from the Actinomycetes phylum (<italic>Mycobacterium</italic> sp.) or Proteobacteria (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp., <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp., etc.). But these are not very efficient degraders of HMW PAHs like pyrene. Bacosa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>) developed six consortia from sediment mainly consisting of different species of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> capable of degrading various PAHs. Availability of extra carbon or nitrogen sources may be limiting factor or the presence of toxic compounds may retard the degradation. So it is very useful to develop a versatile consortium that can degrade pyrene in the presence of other pollutants with their simultaneous degradation, since Amlakhadi canal received mixed pollutants from different surrounding industries (Patel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012a</xref>; Kathuria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">The present study is focused on the development of efficient microbial consortium from the long-term polluted soil sediments of the Amlakhadi canal, Ankleshwar, which is the tributary of the Narmada River and polluted by extensive discharge of effluents from industries of the Ankleshwar Industrial Estate. Optimization of physicochemical parameters, effects of other additives and surfactants and effect of other hydrocarbons and heavy metals were other significant objectives. The most important objective of the study is a simultaneous degradation of mixture of PAHs (fluoranthene, pyrene, naphthalene, chrysene and phenanthrene) and related hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene and xylene) by developed consortium in simulated microcosms. Thus, study provides an important pace for the further bioremediation process like macrocosm study or reactor scale study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Media and chemicals</title><p id="Par5">Bushnell-Haas broth (BHB), nutrient broth and nutrient agar were purchased from Himedia (Mumbai, India).

Thus, after repeated sub-culturing of more than 25 times in minimal medium without any nutritional additives and pyrene provided as sole carbon source, consistent degradation of pyrene with stable growth of the consortium was observed. Further, the degradation of pyrene was observed on Bushnell-Haas agar medium spread with 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of stock solution of pyrene.

Hence, there are relatively very less reports on efficient microbial degradation of pyrene. The present study demonstrated the development of consortium PBR (and its characterization) for the degradation of pyrene from the polluted sediments of Amlakhadi canal, Ankleshwar, Gujarat. The physicochemical parameters of Amlakhadi are shown in Table S1. From Table S1 it is clear that there is the presence of heavy metals in the sediments of the Amlakhadi canal. More than 1200 industrial units are manufacturing petroleum products, chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, bulk drugs, engineering, plastic and many other products and effluents from these industries are released into the Amlakhadi canal. The continual release of these effluents (for the last four decades) containing compounds of xenobiotic origin, have acclimatize the inhabitant microorganisms which have evolved the necessary resilient mechanisms for their metabolism. Hence it was a pertinent site to obtain the enriched bacterial community, having the inherent capacity to metabolize PAHs.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Development of bacterial consortium PBR and bacterial identification</title><p id="Par17">The consortium PBR having pyrene catabolizing ability was developed through culture enrichment method in Bushnell-Haas medium amended with pyrene using sediments of Amlakhadi canal.

This can be determined by kinetic parameters viz. specific growth rate (<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>), specific degradation rate (<italic>q</italic>) and half saturation rate constant (<italic>k</italic>).</p><p id="Par19">From Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, it was clear that 100&#x000a0;ppm of pyrene was efficiently degraded within 7&#x000a0;days as compared to higher concentrations. The degradation efficiency of PBR gradually decreases with increasing pyrene concentrations and it falls nearly 16-fold, where only 640&#x000a0;ppm (i.e. 16%) of 4000&#x000a0;ppm pyrene was degraded by the consortium after 7&#x000a0;days. The results from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> further revealed that, the specific degradation rate (<italic>q</italic>) and specific growth rate (<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>), increases linearly with the increase in pyrene concentrations, in lower range of 25&#x02013;100&#x000a0;ppm.

With the increase in pyrene concentration, the sharp fall in degradation as well as growth rates was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The growth rate decreased nearly 3-fold at 1000&#x000a0;ppm (0.021/h) and 62-fold at 4000&#x000a0;ppm (0.001/h).

Therefore, it could be assessed that, the degradation of pyrene was dependent on the growth of the consortium and it evidently suggested that the decrease in pyrene concentration is biologically mediated rather than abiotic loss. Further, the higher concentrations of pyrene were inhibitory and might be toxic to the consortium retarding the growth of the bacteria.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Effect of pyrene concentrations on its degradation rate (<italic>q</italic>

Proportional utilization of PAH carbon to natural organic carbon is 3 orders of magnitude higher during cooler months when water temperatures are low and dissolved oxygen (DO) percent saturation is higher and infusion of cooler, well-oxygenated water to the water column overlying contaminated sediments during summer stimulates PAH metabolism (Boyd et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2005</xref>).

It is always important to assess the degradation potential of the consortium for their individual and simultaneous degradation of different pollutants. Though, simultaneous degradation of different compounds is a different issue from this where the developed consortia uses multiple strategies to degrade different compounds simultaneously. Therefore, a study has been designed to assess the potential of the consortium PBR for simultaneous degradation of the different PAHs and the effect of other hydrocarbons on the degradation of pyrene. It can be observed from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> that chrysene and fluoranthene completely inhibited pyrene degradation, while it was decreased by 3.1-fold in the presence of naphthalene.

</p><p id="Par30">It is the most important and positive aspect of the developed consortium because during further studies like microcosm or reactor level the consortium must grow in presence of mixture of compounds. The decrease in the rate of degradation of pyrene in the presence of other hydrocarbons may be due to the toxicity of aromatic hydrocarbons like chrysene and fluoranthene. The toxicity is believed to be due to cell membrane disruption by aromatic hydrocarbons (Jacques et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2005</xref>). Moreover, due to structural similarity of many hydrocarbons, the bacterial oxygenases may utilize more than one hydrocarbon and co-metabolize different substrates, however, at significantly low rates (Ascon-Cabrera and Lebeault <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1993</xref>). The observed results are very similar with this notion because degradation of pyrene occurs in the presence of other hydrocarbons but at very low rates relative to control experiment where no other hydrocarbons are added.</p><p id="Par31">Further, in a different study, the results from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> revealed that above 60% of the all the PAHs (eight hydrocarbons) used in the experiments were degraded by the consortium. The degree of degradation of PAHs varies depending upon the test compound. Because the consortium was acclimatized with pyrene maximum degradation was observed with pyrene, followed by naphthalene (89%), benzene (89%) and phenanthrene (85%). The higher rate of degradation of the all the compounds can be attributed to the co-metabolism. Co-metabolism is a very important phenomenon in nature where multiple compounds having similar structures can be degraded concurrently. Yuan et al.

Nearly 35% degradation was observed after seven days in the presence of chromium, zinc and cadmium at 1&#x000a0;mM concentration each, while at the same concentration about more than 50% degradation was observed in the presence of lead and mercury.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;10</label><caption><p>Effect of different heavy metals on pyrene degradation by the consortium PBR under optimized conditions (37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and pH 7, 150&#x000a0;rpm) in BHM</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2017_598_Fig10_HTML" id="MO10"/></fig>

Moreover, Figure S1 shows the relationship between percent growth retardation by different concentrations of heavy metals which was measured as described by Pepi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>.

The high tolerance to heavy metals may be due to production of bio-surfactant by the consortium (Sandrin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2000</xref>) or precipitation of heavy metals by phosphate and sulfate of the medium (Patel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012b</xref>; Hughes and Poole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1991</xref>).

This indicates the ability of developed consortium to work exclusively in presence of components of pristine soil as well as polluted indigenous which reveal the high efficiency of PBR consortium and reveal positive effect of augmentation of PBR consortium. Also the abiotic loss of PAH is negligible in presence of sterile polluted and pristine soil. It can be noted here that in sterile polluted and pristine soils the degradation occurs at 75 and 77%, respectively, as compared to 99% degradation in both non-sterile polluted and pristine soils, which indicates the aid of indigenous microflora for the degradation by PBR consortium. Thus, indigenous microflora also works in cooperation with consortium to increase the degradation rate of pyrene. Also the degradation of pyrene was higher in the presence of non-sterile polluted samples as compared to sterile polluted samples. The &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> for pyrene in 70% ACN was 340&#x000a0;nm and for degradation calculation the O.D. at this wavelength was taken into consideration.

Owing to the growth of consortium and degradation of pyrene in presence of other PAHs and heavy metals, low requirements like nutritional additives and surfactants and successful working in simulated microcosms, the developed consortium is indeed an efficient consortium and can be further used for macrocosm and reactor scale studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
