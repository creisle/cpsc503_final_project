The effect of purification strategies plays a crucial role in getting maximum recovery of yield, purity and biological activity of recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT). In the present work, the task of purifying rhAT from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> BY4741 has been carried out using two different approaches such as cross flow filtration (CFF) system and chromatography methods. In the first approach, the protein was concentrated and partially purified through CFF to achieve maximum recovery yield and purity of 87 and 94&#x000a0;%, respectively. In the second approach, purification involved a single step chromatography with various types of ion exchange and size exclusion resins to analyze the maximum rhAT recovery yield and purity. From the experimental results, it has been observed that the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) technique with Superose 12 matrix was suitable for the purification of rhAT and achieved the maximum recovery yield and purity of 51 and 97&#x000a0;%, respectively. Further, to acquire a high recovery yield and purity of rhAT, the effect of various chromatographic conditions such as mobile phase, mobile phase pH, flow rate, sample volume and sample concentration were also investigated. Under the optimal chromatographic conditions, rhAT was significantly recovered and purified in a single step with maximum recovery yield, purity and biological activity of 67, 99&#x000a0;% and 410&#x000a0;IU/L, respectively. Based on these investigations, it was concluded that SEC with Superose 12 matrix was a more suitable and a potential method for the purification of rhAT.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antithrombin</kwd><kwd>Cross flow filtration</kwd><kwd>Chromatographic purification</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Ion exchange and size exclusion</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antithrombin (AT) is a plasma glycoprotein (432 amino acids) and a member of serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) family, which is an important physiological controller of various clotting factors, including thrombin, factor IXa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa (Rosenberg and Damus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1973</xref>; Franzen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1980</xref>). The inactivation of thrombin by AT under normal physiological conditions is slow, but the rate of complex formation increases in a high degree by heparin cofactor activity (Machovich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1976</xref>). AT has a therapeutic significance for those who suffer from venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with acquired or inherited inadequacy of AT activity (Beresford and Owen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1990</xref>). In these situations, an adequate supply of pure AT is essential.</p><p>Nevertheless, AT is available from human plasma (B&#x000fc;ntemeyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1994</xref>; Munzert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1997</xref>), from the view of product safety and possible virus infection (retrovirus and hepatotropic viruses), AT production must be only way through recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology (Zettlmeissl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1987</xref>). AT has been produced using different expression systems like <italic>E. coli</italic>, Chinese hamster ovary cells and <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>, COS 1 monkey kidney cells, BHK (baby hamster kidney) cells, <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> insect cells, and transgenic goat milk (Bock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1982</xref>; Wasley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1987</xref>; Zettlmeissl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1989</xref>; Gillespie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1991</xref>; Edmunds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1998</xref>), but yeast-based recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT) has been demonstrated only by Broker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1987</xref>).</p><p>To have the capacity to isolate a desired protein from a mixture, the physicochemical properties of the target protein should be used. Till now, there is no single or simple process to purify all kinds of proteins. On the other hand, if the protein is intended for clinical use, it ought to be very pure. But, as considered to be in economic view, purification should be done in a single step.</p><p>The main objective of a purification process is not only the exclusion of undesired contaminants, but also the purification of the target protein (Roe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2001</xref>). Ion exchange chromatography (IEC) is certainly the most commonly used technique for the separation and purification of proteins, polypeptides, nucleic acids, poly nucleotides, and other bio molecules. The explanations behind the accomplishment of IEC are its determining power, broad relevance, high capacity, and the effortlessness of the system (Bonnerjea et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1986</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is another purification process, in which components are filtered according to their size, and in some times molecular mass. It is frequently used to purify the larger or macro molecules such as proteins and industrial polymers (Paul-Dauphin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, purification of rhAT from <italic>Sacharomyces cerevisiae</italic> BY4741 has been carried out using two different approaches such as cross flow filtration (CFF) and chromatography methods to achieve high recovery yields and purity. In addition, the effect of various physicochemical parameters such as mobile phase, mobile phase pH, flow rate, sample volume and sample concentration on rhAT purification were also investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and instrumentation</title><p>Tris or Tris aminomethane and 2-mercaptoetahnol were procured from Merck Millipore (USA).

In the present work, a study has been carried out on phosphate buffer with different pH values ranging from 6.5 to 9 to estimate their effect on recovery yield and purity of rhAT. The recovery yield and purity of rhAT at various phosphate buffer pH values were shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. From the experimental results, recovery yields (48, 50, 51, 53, 55 and 52&#x000a0;%) and purities (97, 97, 98, 98, 98 and 98&#x000a0;%) of rhAT were obtained with respective mobile phase pH such as 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5 and 9. It has been clearly observed that the maximum recovery yield (55&#x000a0;%) and purity (98&#x000a0;%) of rhAT was observed with buffer at pH 8.5. The lowest recovery yield (48&#x000a0;%) and purity (97&#x000a0;%) of rhAT was observed with buffer at pH 6.5. Even though the purity was high (98&#x000a0;%) at pH 7.5,8 and 9, low recovery yields (51, 53 and 52&#x000a0;%) were observed when compared to pH 8.5.The mobile phase pH on recombinant protein purification was also successfully analyzed by previously reported work (Vemula et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Effect of mobile pH on rhAT purification, the maximum yield (55&#x000a0;%) and purity (98&#x000a0;%) of rhAT was shown with pH 8.5. <italic>Filled diamond</italic> represents recovery yield; <italic>Filled square</italic> represents purity.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Effect of flow rate on rhAT purification</title><p>Flow rate should be considered as one of the most significant parameters during protein purification, because in size-based separations, it may influence the protein structure, biological activity and recovery yield. In the present work, a study has been conducted with different flow rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0&#x000a0;mL/min to show the impact of flow rate on rhAT purification. The recovery yield and purity of rhAT at different flow rates were shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. From the experimental results, recovery yields (59, 66, 61 and 57&#x000a0;%) and purities (98, 99, 98 and 98&#x000a0;%) of rhAT were obtained with respective flow rates such as 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2&#x000a0;mL/min flow rate. It can be clearly seen that the high recovery yield (66&#x000a0;%) and purity (99&#x000a0;%) of rhAT was obtained with 1&#x000a0;mL/min flow rate. Although using lower sample flow rates results in longer run times, the increased resolution gives greater confidence and optimum column efficiency (Oliva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2001</xref>). The low recovery yield (57&#x000a0;%) was observed with 2&#x000a0;ml/min, due to high acceleration, which increased the chance of escaping and decreased the passage of the sample from the resin resulting in low recovery yields. Though the purity of rhAT is similar at 0.5, 1.5 and 2 flow rates, variations in recovery yields (59, 61 and 57&#x000a0;%) were observed. Hence further experiments were carried out with 1.0&#x000a0;mL/min flow rate. The results obtained in this study were very close to the previously reported work (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>)<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Effect of flow rate on rhAT purification.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Effect of sample volume on rhAT purification</title><p>Sample injection volume can influence the protein purification and affects mostly on recovery yields. Therefore, in the present study, several experiments were carried out on rhAT purification with different sample volumes such as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5&#x000a0;mL. The recovery yield and purity profiles of rhAT with varying sample volumes were shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. From the experimental results, recovery yields (55, 60, 57, 56 and 58&#x000a0;%) and purities (98, 98, 98, 98 and 98&#x000a0;%) of rhAT were obtained with respective sample volumes such as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5&#x000a0;mL. From result analysis, it was concluded that the maximum recovery yield (60&#x000a0;%) and purity (98&#x000a0;%) with the sample volume of 2&#x000a0;mL were observed. This is attributed to the suitable volume of the sample that enters through the resin and increases the passage of desired protein molecules. The lowest recovery yields of 55 and 56&#x000a0;% were achieved with 1 and 4&#x000a0;mL volumes, respectively. This is due to broadening of sample zone by increasing the sample volume and decreased the passage of the sample through the resin. Therefore, further studies were continued with 2&#x000a0;mL sample volume.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Effect of sample volume on rhAT purification.
