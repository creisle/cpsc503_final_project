High-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of the above-mentioned plant parts, collected at their 60-day-old growth stage, was performed via methanolic extraction and with the aid of toluene:butanol:butyl acetate (9:0.5:0.5; <italic>v/v/v</italic>) solvent system.

<italic>Adhatoda vasica</italic> Nees (syn, <italic>Justicia adhatoda</italic> L.), commonly known as Malabar Nut (or Vasaka) is a perennial shrub and belongs to the family Acanthaceae. It grows in sub-Himalayan tracts and has conventionally been utilized in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine for more than 2000&#x000a0;years (Jayapaul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>). It is basically an evergreen shrub of 1&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;m height with opposite ascending branches producing a vile smell and bitter taste. Several ethnopharmacological studies on <italic>A. vasica</italic> reported the aerial portions of the plant (like stem, leaf, flower, fruit and seeds) to contain vasicine, vasicinone (Suthar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>), vasicine acetate and 2-acetyl benzyl amine (Ignacimuthus and Shanmugam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>), adhatodine and vasicoline (Ahmad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>). <italic>A. vasica</italic> leaves and stems have been utilized as a herbal medication for allergen-induced respiratory diseases, rheumatism, malarial fever, gastrointestinal disorders, haemorrhage, skin diseases and many other ailments, occurring in countries like India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (reviewed by Claeson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>). <italic>A. vasica</italic> has been included in the WHO manual for health workers in Southeast Asia owing to its recurrent usage, conveniently devoid of any serious side effects (World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1990</xref>). Vasicinone, the central autooxidation by-product of vasicine, has been documented to exhibit bronchodilatory, cardiac-stimulating and anti-anaphylactic effects (Bhide et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1976</xref>; Shinawie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2002</xref>). One of the commercial produces of <italic>A. vasica</italic> is Adulsa, a cough syrup (Roja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>). There is a significant requirement of <italic>A. vasica</italic>-based drugs in the Indian subcontinent and this demand is being satisfied from the natural plant population so far. Inaptly, seed germination rate of <italic>A. vasica</italic> is poor and traditional propagation through vegetative approach is inadequate (Mathew et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1998</xref>), which prompts significant depletion of the source of pharmaceutically important metabolites like vasicinone. This existing scenario calls for an alternative approach in the form of in vitro propagation that could complement the traditional system of propagation, and crop up as a better source for secondary metabolites extraction. Nowadays plant organ, tissue and cell culture system have been exhaustively explored as a substitute for the production of secondary metabolites, avoiding any loss in natural plant population in majority of the medicinal plant species (Ramachandra Rao and Ravishankar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>; Komaraiah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>; Gantait et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>). Yet, the comparative assessment of secondary metabolite among in vitro and in vivo plant parts is of utmost importance from an economic viewpoint; however, such study has been attempted only once (Garg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>) in <italic>A. vasica</italic>, to the best of our knowledge. The propagation conditions (in vitro or in vivo) assisting the accumulation of high concentration of vasicinone in <italic>A. vasica</italic> are undetermined as well.</p><p id="Par3">Earlier reported techniques for the vasicinone quantification comprises high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) (Avula et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>), reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) (Garg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>), and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (UHPLC&#x02013;ESI/MS/MS) (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>), along with high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) as well. Presently, HPTLC is being widely used for its systematic method validation, consistency in the quantification of analytes (precisely in nanogram levels) and cost effectiveness. The prime benefit of HPTLC is curtailment of time and cost per analysis (Dharmender et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). Effective use of HPTLC has been well documented in some major economically important medicinal plants for their respective secondary metabolite assay (Gantait et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>; Swain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>; Varghese et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013</xref>; Bala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>; Shuayprom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>), but only three reports are available on vasicinone quantification from in vivo plant samples of <italic>A. vasica</italic> (Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2005</xref>; Suthar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>; Roja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>) with none on comparative quantification (between in vivo and in vitro plant parts) of vasicinone.</p><p id="Par4">The present study was therefore focused on the simultaneous production and relative assessment of vasicinone through HPTLC from both the in vivo and in vitro plant parts of <italic>A. vasica</italic>, and optimizing the major sink of accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Collection of plant materials</title><p id="Par5">The stem-cuttings of <italic>A. vasica</italic> Nees were collected from Medicinal and Aromatic Research Centre, Anand Agriculture University, Anand, Gujarat, India, and propagated through traditional vegetative method (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).

It was evident from our study that vasicinone could be produced concurrently from different parts of the plant irrespective of in vitro or in vivo environments. Such outcome certainly will encourage the pharmaceutical industry to use both these methods to complement each other to meet the bulk demand of <italic>A. vasica</italic>-based drug industries in the Indian subcontinent for vasicinone source. However, in a comparison, during in vivo and in vitro vasicinone production, it was detected that samples from in vitro condition produced a better yield than the other one. The highest quantity of vasicinone (6.402&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.010% of dry weight) was measured from in vitro leaves followed by calli (5.222&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.092%) and in vitro stems (2.007&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.041%). In contrast, in vivo leaves and stems produced comparatively lower levels of vasicinone (2.412&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.139 and 1.933&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.046%, respectively) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This result is corroborated by the previous report of Roja et al.

It was noteworthy to mention that the vasicinone quantity from the in vitro leaves was almost 2.5-fold higher than its in vivo counterpart. An earlier study (Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2005</xref>) reported that the vasicinone production in leaves (in vivo) was higher (0.047%; <italic>w/w</italic>) in comparison to stem (in vivo) (0.027%; <italic>w/w</italic>) of <italic>A. vasica</italic>, which supports our results where we found leaf samples to be the superior choice for vasicinone extraction than the other plant parts. Significant variation in vasicinone content was observed among in vitro leaf, callus and in vivo leaf; nonetheless, in vitro stem and in vivo stems yielded comparable quantities of vasicinone. The coefficient of variation (CV%) of individual samples was recorded to be 8.133% (in vivo leaf), 3.35% (in vivo stem), 0.219% (in vitro leaf), 0.129% (in vitro stem) or 2.864% (callus). The quantity of vasicinone production in our report (6.402% from in vitro leaf) is highest among any other reports on <italic>A. vasica</italic> [(Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2005</xref> reported 0.047%), (Avula et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref> reported 0.97%), (Suthar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref> reported 0.45%), (Roja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref> reported 5.2%), (Garg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref> reported 0.56%)]. Such augmented production of vasicinone from in vitro leaves might be attributed to the controlled physical environment of growth room and interplay among endogenous and exogenous plant growth regulators during tissue culture.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Comparative vasicinone content (mean value&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard error bar; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) in various (in vivo and in vitro) plant parts of <italic>Adhatoda vasica</italic> Nees.

</p><p id="Par18">In vitro culture of plant cell, tissue and organ are accounted as an improved system to yield valuable phytochemicals with medicinal properties (Gantait and Kundu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). Plant growth regulators used in vitro was found to augment some metabolic activities and ameliorate phytochemical accumulation in tissue cultured plantlets unlike in their in vivo counterparts (Pandey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). According to Gantait et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2014</xref>), the use of sterilizing agents, plant source, plant growth regulators, culture conditions as well as accumulation of phenolics may significantly enhance the quality of in vitro-regenerated plants. Plants are the main source to provide novel products and act as chemical models for new drug discoveries (Cox and Balick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1994</xref>). The rapid development of plant tissue culture and cell culture leads to the production of more secondary metabolites on a large scale (Ramachandra Rao and Ravishankar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>; Debnath et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2006</xref>;&#x000a0;Gantait et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>). Generally, secondary plant products can be produced throughout the year with the advent of plant tissue culture. Simultaneously, the product would be reliable, predictable and independent of seasonal barriers, plus it complements the conventional production system of secondary metabolites. At times, the in vitro yield of secondary product may exceed from that of the in vivo parent plant parts (Karuppusamy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>), similar to the present study, wherein the in vitro yield of vasicinone surpassed than that of the in vivo parts of <italic>A. vasica</italic>. Despite the fact that vasicinone can be harvested from any aerial plant part, our findings based on vasicinone profiling revealed that the leaf, especially&#x000a0;the in vitro one is the key source. This way of ensuring high vasicinone yield per unit biomass, concurrently through in vivo and in vitro approach, indicates the chemical process of vasicinone to be much easier and more economical.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par19">Since there is a high demand for vasicinone in the global market of plant-derived drugs, farming activities on <italic>A. vasica</italic> should principally be emphasized on boosting the vasicinone quantity and biomass (especially the leaves). In our present report, we proposed an avenue for large-scale production of vasicinone, simultaneously exploiting both the conventional and tissue culture methods. Furthermore, we substantiated the in vitro clonal propagation as a superior technique to yield the augmented quantity of vasicinone in comparison to in vivo propagation method; the in vitro approach can further be utilized for the amelioration of vasicinone production through biotic and abiotic elicitors and/or stresses developed during tissue culture. The implication of this work can possibly bring down the commercial cost of production of this economically important alkaloid through complementation of in vivo and in vitro approaches.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Authors are grateful to Medicinal and Aromatic Research Centre, Anand Agriculture University (AAU) for providing the plant materials for the present study and Dr. M.A. Patel, Research Scientist, AAU, for his help in identifying the plant species.
