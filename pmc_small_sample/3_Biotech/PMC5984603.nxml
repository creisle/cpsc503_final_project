(green chilli), an important member of Solanaceae family, is mainly grown as a cash crop owing to its distinctly pungent non-climacteric fruits, enriched with vitamins and minerals. Inspite of having such high nutritional values it has limited storage-life (Panigrahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>), which is a major problem for fruits and vegetable growers. Following its harvest, the fruits undergo gradual deterioration due to desiccation, oxidative reactions, microbial growth, and other biochemical changes. Such rapid deterioration in the form of softening, wrinkling, wilting and decaying of the harvested produce during storage and transportation, fail to provide the anticipated profit, consumer-acceptance or to even meet the actual cultivation cost. Softening of fruits is directly linked with water loss during storage (Lownds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1994</xref>; Rao and Shivashankara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>).</p><p>Herein, external coating(s), acting as partial barrier to water vapour, gases and restricting rapid metabolism, might be helpful to preserve the texture, quality and external appearance of harversted fruits, and in due course may also improve their storage-life, significantly influencing the functions of storage-associated biochemicals and antioxidants (Baldwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1994</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>; Panigrahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>). External coatings comprise hydrophobics (lipids or waxes), hydrocolloids (polysaccharides or proteins) or a combination of both the compounds (composite coatings). The coating composition determines the barrier properties of the material with respect to water vapour, oxygen, carbon dioxide and lipid transfer in food systems (Guilbert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>). Even though hydrophilic coatings function as excellent carbon dioxide and oil barriers and provide strength and structural integrity to the fruits, however, they are not at all effective moisture barriers and can create adverse anaerobic conditions (McHugh and Krochta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1994</xref>). Hydrophobic lipid or oil coatings have good water vapour barrier properties, due to their low polarity (Guilbert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>). Usually, climacteric fruits like green peppers do not show any detectable changes in respiration rates during storage (Conforti and Zinck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2002</xref>). However, it was recorded that when cucumber and bell pepper were exogenously coated with chitosan, the rate of respiration noticably reduced (Ghaouth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1991</xref>). Furthermore, Wong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1994</xref>) reported that when cut apple pieces were treated with multilayer coatings, it aided in maintaining the internal carbon dioxide concentrations.</p><p>Castor oil is an important vegetable oil with a rich source of ricinoleic acid, a mono-unsaturated, 18-carbon fatty acid. Ricinoleic acid amid all the other fatty acids, is exceptional since it includes a hydroxyl group on its twelfth carbon; it is for the virtue of this functional group that ricinoleic acid (and castor oil) is more polar than the other fats (Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). Castor oil proved to be efficient with its greater resistance to increased CO<sub>2</sub> and reduced O<sub>2</sub> in the internal environ of fruits, in comparison to that of the essential oils or mineral oils. Castor oil coating significantly delayed the softening and retained the flavour in fruits (Baldwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1994</xref>). Owing to such property, the castor oil coating on seeds of edible pulse or oilseed crops is being used traditionally, to extend the storage life since long, in the southern districts of Gujarat State, India (Parmar and Jain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>). There are several reports on postharvest storage-life of <italic>C. annuum</italic> published till date that include semperfresh edible coating (&#x000d6;zden and Bayindirli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2002</xref>), shellac-based surface coating (Chitravathi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>), essential oil (cinnamon) coating (Ali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>), and gibberellic acid coating (Panigrahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>).</p><p>However, there is no report that addresses the efficacy of castor oil as a coating to slow down the postharvest ripening process till date. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated the influence of castor oil as an external coating on different storage-associated biochemical and antioxidant activities with the aim to extend the postharvest storage-life of <italic>C. annuum</italic> L.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Collection, preparation and castor oil coating of fruits</title><p>Mature <italic>C. annuum</italic> fruits (var.

Although the titratable acidity showed a decreasing trend in both non-coated and coated fruits with the passage of storage period, yet at the same time it was better maintained in coated fruits (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The coated fruits displayed an extended storage-life up to 36 days, which was significantly longer as compared to the non-coated fruits having a limited storage period of 18 days only. On the other note, the decline in titratable acidity value was observed to be instantaneous in comparison to the steady reduction in case of coated fruits. The probable reason of such outcome might be attributed to lesser metabolic activities (&#x000d6;zden and Bayindirli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2002</xref>) and delay in consumption of citric acids (Yaman and Bayindirli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>). Citric acid is the prime substrate for respiration, wherein a decrease in acidity level and a rise in pH level are coupled with highly respiring fruits (Panigrahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>). However, the decline in titratable acidity is a vital event during ripening, since it turns the fruits less acidic or sour (Valero and Serrano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2010</xref>). Following the harvest of fruits, the respiration increases with a decrease in citric acid and other intermediate products of TCA cycle. The coating on fruit surface might have hindered the sudden rise in respiration and consequent postharvest maturation, which was also reported earlier by Yaman and Bayindirli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>).</p><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Ascorbic acid content</title><p>The ascorbic acid contents in both castor oil-coated and non-coated fruits showed gradual decline (but with significant difference in between) throughout the storage period. Castor oil coating secured the significantly higher ascorbic acid content (~&#x02009;9.476&#x000a0;mg/10&#x000a0;g fruit) at the same storage duration (18 days) than the non-coated ones (~&#x02009;3.500&#x000a0;mg/10&#x000a0;g fruit) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Similar trend in variation of ascorbic acid content during postharvest storage was also observed in kinnow (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>). It has been well established that, ascorbic acid level varies with genotypic variations, pre-harvest climatic conditions, level of maturity and postharvest handling methods (Plaza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). Ascorbic acid is generally degraded by oxidative process, which is accelerated in the presence of light, oxygen and enzymes like peroxidase (Plaza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). Similarly, during the storage of orange juice it was observed that the vitamin C content was affected by the storage conditions, packing, and processing (Ayhan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>; Polydera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Total phenolic content</title><p>Total phenolic content showed an inversely proportional pattern in both the non-coated and castor oil-coated fruits in connection with the storage-duration, yet the quantity was maintained better in the coated ones (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Immediately after harvest, the phenolic content starts to decline both in non-coated and coated fruits. The total phenolic content at the commencement of storage (at 0&#x000a0;day) was recorded to be the highest (~&#x02009;0.558&#x000a0;mg GAE/g fruit). It sustained significantly longer in coated fruits up to a postharvest storage period of 36 days. It was observed that the coated fruits maintained the total phenolic content for a longer period when compared to the non-coated ones. A comparable trend in total phenolic content during postharvest storage of gibberellic acid coated <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> was most recently reported by Panigrahi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>). Phenolic compounds are potential antioxidants and free radical scavengers. In addition, phenolic compounds deal with the growth and reproduction, simultaneously protecting the fruits against predators and pathogens (Bravo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Total soluble sugar content</title><p>With the extension of storage period, the quantity of total soluble sugar tended to increase in both the castor oil-coated and non-coated fruits. Interestingly, the degree of this increase in total soluble sugar content was significantly higher in non-coated fruits at the very early stage (9 days) of storage; however, the coated fruits surpassed the content of total soluble sugar in its later stages of storage (18&#x02013;36 days). The highest sugar content was observed to be ~&#x02009;272.6&#x000a0;mg/g following 36 days of storage in coated fruits. On the contrary, the non-coated fruits registered significantly lower quantities (~&#x02009;242.0&#x000a0;mg/g) of sugar even at 18 days of storage, following which the fruits perished (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). As the fruits proceeded towards ripening, the macromolecules degraded into micromolecules in order to be used up rapidly. In contrast of that, in the present study, the mature fruits under storage multiplied the total soluble sugar content and thus maintained their quality for a longer period, that could be highly qualified for consumer acceptance. The present results of change in total soluble sugar content corroborates previous studies on the use of coatings in tomato (Beckles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>DPPH radical scavenging activity</title><p>DPPH radical scavenging activity is recognized based on the power of DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), an unchanging free radical, to bleach out the presence of antioxidants. The castor oil coating on fruits scavenged the DPPH radicals by higher percentages (~&#x02009;3.037%) as compared to non-coated ones (~&#x02009;2.250%), at the same time it improved the storage-life of fruits up to 36 days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). The DPPH radical is basically reduced to form DPPH-H and the said reduction is done by polysaccharide extract. A positive correlation of postharvest ripening process and DPPH activity was observed in <italic>Lycium barbarum</italic> fruits (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>). But, initial increase and gradual decrease in the DPPH activity was observed in fresh cut pears and tomato (Oms-Oliu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). It is noteworthy to mention that there are also several other factors influencing DPPH activities such as environmental and genetic backgrounds, methodology of harvest and postharvest storage conditions (Dumas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Ferrous ion chelating activity</title><p>Ferrous ions are most efficient pro-oxidants in biological systems, since their interaction with hydrogen peroxide leads to formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The ferrous ion chelating activity of coated and non-coated fruits under postharvest storage is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f. Significant differences in the trends of increasing ferrous ion chelating activity in coated and non-coated fruits were observed during storage. Ferrous ion chelating activity gradually increased in both the coated and non-coated fruits, but it persisted more in the coated fruits and lasted for 36 days that was substantially (18 days) for a longer duration as compared to the non-coated ones. The role of iron as a transition metal creates free radicals from peroxides by the Fenton reaction and creates several diseases (Halliwell and Gutteridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1990</xref>). Fe<sup>+&#x02009;2</sup> is also used in lipid peroxidation and such reduction of Fe<sup>+&#x02009;2</sup> concentration during Fenton&#x02019;s reaction can avoid oxidative damage (Singh and Rajini 2004).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity</title><p>With the advancement of storage period, the hydroxyl radical scavenging activities of both the castor oil-coated and non-coated fruits were recorded to increase consistantly. However, the coated fruits sustained the 36-day storage period with the highest hydroxyl radical scavenging activity value of ~&#x02009;2.324% as compared to the non-coated fruits (~&#x02009;2.02%), that thrived only up to a 18-day postharvest storage period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The most important active oxygen species that cause lipid oxidation and biological damage are hydroxyl radicals (Gutteridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1984</xref>). In our study, castor oil coating proved to be efficient in minimizing the hydroxyl radical development with enhanced scavenging activity. Similar trend of such increasing hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in gibberellic acid coated <italic>C. annuum</italic> L. was reported by Panigrahi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>).</p><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Reducing power activity</title><p>The decreased absorbance of reaction mixture represents a drop in reducing power. The reducing power activity of castor oil-coated fruits was recorded to incline at initial stage (9 days) and decline in successive days of storage that by and by extended up to 36 days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). For non-coated fruits such activity displayed a continuous declining trend. This suggests the direct contribution of antioxidant activity put forward by the castor oil coating during the extended storage of fruits, resisting the aging process. Such initial incline and late decline of the reducing power activity was also reported by Sim and Sil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2008</xref>) in <italic>Capsicum</italic> pericarp. Reducing power serves as an important evidence of antioxidant activity. Compounds with reducing power are electron donors and hence can act as primary and secondary antioxidants. Here, during the assessment method, the transformation of the yellow coloured solution to a blue one confirmed the effect on the reducing power of each compound (Dave <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Pectate lyase activity</title><p>Pectic enzymes play the key role to soften the tissues of fruits and vegetables during the ripening process; and it is also during this course that changes in the elements of cell wall and esterification of pectin is typically observed. In our present study, it was observed that the activity of pectate lyase enzyme increased in the beginning of the storage period&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.249 (U/mg proteins) but declined till the end of the storage; this activity lasted (~&#x02009;0.095 U/mg proteins) for 36 days in the coated fruits (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) and conversely for 18 days in case of the non-coated fruits. Interestingly, pectate lyase enzyme activity diminished (~&#x02009;0.149 U/mg proteins) at a faster rate up to 18 days of storage period in the non-coated fruits. However, the limited activity was observed in all the coated fruits in contrast to that of the non-coated ones, which suggested that castor oil contributed to the formation of a layer over the fruits that might have decreased the availability of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> and supported natural inhibition of fruit senescence by restricting the functions of cell wall degenerating enzymes. Such restriction in the ripening mechanism through regulated pectate lyase activity was reported in green bell peppers using hydrocolloid-lipid coating (Conforti and Zinck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Polyphenol oxidase activity</title><p>In the present experiment, the polyphenol oxidase value during initiation of storage was ~&#x02009;0.0533 (U/100&#x000a0;mg fruit pulp) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). The polyphenol oxidase activity showed an initial increase and gradual significant decrease towards the end of the storage period, both in non-coated as well as castor oil-coated fruits. However, the polyphenol oxidase activity comparatively faced greater inhibition in all the coated fruits. Such initial increase and gradual inhibition of polyphenol oxidase activity was reported during cold storage of nitric oxide treated banana. Polyphenol oxidase is a terminal oxidase existing in plants that catalyses oxidation of phenolics resulting in tissue browning of fruits and vegetables (Zhang and Quantick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1997</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The application of castor oil as an external coating on <italic>C. annuum</italic> fruits resulted in restricted metabolic activities, regulated functions of associated biochemicals and antioxidants during cold storage, delaying the ageing process as a result. Eventually, this has prolonged the storage-life of <italic>C. annuum</italic> up to 36 days. Till date, castor oil is traditionally used as a preservative during storage of food grains (viz. seeds of rice, pulses, oilseeds etc.) only. Based on the results we recorded in this study, it can be suggested that the described method can be used by farmers to preserve other fruits and vegetables for a longer period, since it is non-hazardous, biodegradable and of low-cost in comparison to other chemical coatings.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>JP, SG&#x02014;Conceived the research idea and designed the experiments; MP, NP, BG&#x02014;Executed the experiments; JP, SG&#x02014;Performed statistical analysis, interpreted the results and wrote the manuscript.
