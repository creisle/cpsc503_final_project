These solvents, organic salts by nature, exhibit unique properties like negligible vapor pressure, high solvating ability and thermal stability. They simultaneously offer the advantage of being easily modifiable, which confers on them different properties based on the cation and anion modified. These have, hence, been termed as &#x0201c;designer solvents&#x0201d; (Dixit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">The exploitation of ILs is majorly in the area of biomass processing for the generation of second-generation biofuels (Hou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>; Sheldon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>). The lignocellulosic biomass is quite recalcitrant in nature due to the presence of cellulose component. Hence, it is pre-treated with ILs in the first step to loosen it or to make it accessible for enzyme-mediated saccharification in the subsequent step (Khare et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). Since ILs have shown to exert toxic effect towards saccharifying enzymes like cellulases and xylanases, the IL-pre-treated biomass has to be washed with water several times to remove the residual IL (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>). In this context, the present approaches deal with the screening or engineering of enzymes which are stable in the presence of ILs so that the whole process can be carried out in a single pot (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>). Due to the high cost of enzymes, biocatalysis using microbial cells has recently gained momentum, since it is cost effective and maintains a native domain for functioning of enzymes (de Carvalho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>). On similar lines, if the microbial cells are stable towards the ILs effect, the enzymes produced by them will also be active under such conditions thereby enabling the development of an in situ pre-treatment and saccharification approach. The suitability of ILs for biocatalytic whole-cell applications is gaining momentum but the studies pertaining to it are quite limited due to toxic effects of ILs on many microorganisms (Shen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). Generally the conventional types of ILs are quite damaging to the bacterial cells causing membrane perturbance and lysis (Bhattacharya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>). However, molecular level understanding on the&#x000a0;interaction of ILs with bacteria, yeast or fungus is presently limited.</p><p id="Par4"><italic>S. thermophile</italic> (syn. <italic>Myceliophthora thermophile</italic>) is known to produce a&#x000a0;number of industrially relevant enzymes such as xylanases, cellulases, phytases, esterases and pectinases (Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>). To further explore the usefulness of using <italic>S. thermophile</italic> cells for IL-mediated saccharification, their stability in ILs has been previously studied (Sadaf and Khare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>). In this work, it was observed that <italic>S. thermophile</italic> was able to grow profusely and produce xylanase in the presence of two most commonly used ILs, [EMIM][OAc] and [BMIM][MeSO<sub>4</sub>], indicating high tolerance of the fungus towards these ILs. The IL stability of these adapted cultures further led to cell-based simultaneous pre-treatment and saccharification.</p><p id="Par5">A mechanistic understanding of the effects of ILs on fungal cells can help to explain such stability and outline future possibilities of enhancing biotransformation yield. Considering this, <italic>Sporotrichum thermophile</italic> was selected to further study IL-induced stress responses upon exposure to a compatible IL, [EMIM][OAc] which did not majorly affect <italic>S. thermophile</italic> growth and xylanase production and a highly non-compatible IL, [BMIM][BF<sub>4</sub>], which drastically inhibited <italic>S. thermophile</italic> growth and xylanase production. Hence, the anti-oxidative enzyme levels and global proteomic changes in <italic>S. thermophile</italic> were studied under the influence of these two ILs. With few proteomic studies on fungal systems reported, the current work is relevant since proteomic analysis on IL interaction with an extremophilic fungus is being reported for the first time. An interpretation of the fungal behavior upon IL exposure will help in expanding the knowledge on IL induced stress as well as its adaptations.&#x000a0;Results from this study will also help to reflect on how such unique solvents can be used in future to manipulate proteins of biotechnological relevance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par6">1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [BMIM][BF<sub>4</sub>] and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-acetate [EMIM][OAc] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

This indicates that this pathway has been enhanced under IL-stress, suggesting a possible survival strategy under stress conditions (Wu and Wei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>). Spot No. 9 which was also upregulated matched with transaldolase, an enzyme involved in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway. The expression of this enzyme has been shown to increase in early oxidative stress conditions (de Arruda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). The upregulation of this pathway under oxidative stress conditions generates NADPH which plays a defensive role against oxidative damage (Voodisch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>). Another upregulated spot in both ILs (Spot No. 19) was identified as isocitrate dehydrogenase which is a citric acid/TCA cycle enzyme. The NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyses the formation of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, a key intermediate involved in ROS regulation (Goncalves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>; Mailloux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>). The expression of pentose phosphate pathway proteins as well as increased levels of isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme have been shown to increase majorly in response to various types of oxidative stress conditions like temperature, osmotic, pH, etc. to generate reducing power (Tomanek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>). The levels of ATP synthase and mitochondrial ATP synthase corresponding to Spots Nos. 50 and 224, respectively, increased only in the presence of [EMIM][OAc] indicating greater energy requirements (Soini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>). Downregulated spots No. 1 and 10 (not visible in gel images) in both ILs were identified as malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, respectively. A drop in expression levels of TCA cycle enzymes probably explains the slowing down of TCA cycle. Similar results have been observed in the case of <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> yeast cells coping under oxidative stress induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (de Arruda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). Spot no. 7 was identified as 60S ribosomal protein and was downregulated in both the ILs. Similarly, spots nos. 76 and 35 were identified as, EF-1&#x003b2; and nucleotide diphosphate kinase, respectively, and were downregulated only in [BMIM][BF<sub>4</sub>] indicating retardation of protein synthesis machinery. In environment stress conditions, the lowering of protein synthesis has earlier been implicated in the reduction of ROS, since this process leads to generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Tomanek, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). Spots Nos. 182, 263, 97 pertaining to newly developed spots generated exclusively in the presence of ILs were identified as HSP70 and catalase/peroxidase. Heat shock proteins have also been reported to be expressed in <italic>Paracoccidioides yeast</italic> cells exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress conditions (de Arruda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). While HSP70 is a molecular chaperone responsible for maintaining the correct folding of proteins under stress conditions, catalase/peroxidase proteins are anti-oxidative enzymes which protect cell from ROS-induced damage (de Arruda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). Therefore, the above results indicate the induction of oxidative stress on exposure to ILs.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Characteristics and function of intracellular proteins affected in <italic>S. thermophile</italic> grown in presence of ionic liquids</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Protein spot No.</th><th align="left">Protein name</th><th align="left">Expression level</th><th align="left">NCBI accession number</th><th align="left">Mol wt.

The study reports the effect of two imidazolium-based ionic liquids, [EMIM][OAc] and [BMIM][BF<sub>4</sub>] on the intracellular anti-oxidative enzymes activities as well as the proteome of <italic>S. thermophile</italic>. Global proteome analysis indicated IL-induced generation of oxidative stress, causing metabolic regulation of many important pathways and anti-oxidative enzymes. While on one hand, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway as well as ATP synthesis were found to be upregulated, on the other hand, TCA cycle and protein synthesis pathways were found to be retarded. An overall surge for NADPH production and reduction of ROS generation was revealed from the proteomic data. The study, thus, provides an important insight into the mechanism of action of imidazolium-based compatible and non-compatible ILs. It also adds to the emerging evidences of fungal adaptation responses and how such unique solvents can manipulate protein behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
