Inclusion of QCs in the testing process allows for the detection of system errors and ongoing assessment of the reliability of the assay. Changes in the performance of QCs are indicative of changes in the assay behavior caused by unintended alterations to reagents or to the operating conditions.

Successful management of QC life cycle requires rigorous and established methodologies for preparation, qualification as well as for monitoring QC performance. Although the procedures and acceptance criteria for the preparation and qualification of the LBA QCs have been addressed in regulatory agency guidance documents and in LBA literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>), such publications discuss these parameters to a limited extent to cover method development and pre-study validation phases. The subject matter of QC life cycle management and the factors critical to this process have not been previously addressed. Many questions regarding production and qualification of replacement batches of QCs in such a manner that lot to lot consistency is maintained and assay drift is prevented, remain unanswered. Additionally, the majority of bioanalytical laboratories lack established methodologies or statistical tools to trend QCs, a practice that is of paramount importance to monitoring performance and managing the life cycle of quality controls.</p><p id="Par3">This publication aims to fill in the gap by providing guidelines for the management of LBA QC life cycle and its components including recommendations and best practices for QC preparation, qualification, and performance trending. A collective view of the LBA community on the subject matter is presented here. The authors&#x02019; goal is to help bioanalytical laboratories with defining QC qualification and lot to lot consistency guidelines in their standard operating procedures (SOPs). Assay- and study-specific requirements and specifications should be considered and detailed in the validated method or in the sample analysis plan of individual laboratory. This article primarily focuses on quantitative and qualitative LBAs such as pharmacokinetic (PK) and anti-drug antibody (ADA) assays although many discussions presented here are equally relevant to biomarker assays. All other assay categories are outside the scope of this publication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>PREPARATION OF QUALITY CONTROLS</title><p id="Par4">Reference standard, matrix pool, QC composition, equipment, and the production strategy are all critical factors in the preparation of LBA QCs; these are discussed in the sections below.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Composition of Quality Controls</title><p id="Par5">QCs should be prepared using a matrix that is similar and as close as possible to the study matrix. For example, if study samples are serum which has not been filtered, centrifuged, or charcoal-stripped, the QC matrix pool should also be unfiltered, non-centrifuged, and non-charcoal-stripped serum of the same species. Undiluted (100%) matrix should be used in the preparation of QCs so that QCs could be subjected to the same dilution steps [such as minimum required dilution (MRD)] as the study samples. Exceptions to this rule, such as substitution of a surrogate for a rare study matrix, require justification and are permissible only where matrix conservation is necessary. Examples of rare matrix include cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, or ocular matrices from certain species which are often difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities. A recommended approach to mitigate matrix volume issue would be to prepare 2 of the 3 QC levels in a surrogate matrix and only one level in the study matrix. If a surrogate matrix is used, its equivalence to the study matrix should be demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). It is preferable to use the same lot of the matrix as used for the preparation of calibrators, to generate QCs to enhance consistency and reproducibility if selectivity has been demonstrated during pre-study validation. The intermediate stock, which is the spiking solution of the analyte used to generate QCs, may be prepared in a diluent other than the study matrix such as water, buffer, or organic media so long as the final composition of the QC is at least 95% (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) matrix when water or buffer intermediate stocks are used and a minimum of 99% (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) matrix when organic solvents (e.g., DMSO or acetic acid) are used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Independent Preparation of QCs</title><p id="Par6">Preparation of QCs should be independent of calibrators to prevent systemic spiking errors. In that regards, it is recommended that separate intermediate stocks and dilution steps be used to prepare QCs <italic>versus</italic> calibrators. It is also recommended that QCs be spiked independently at each level instead of through serial dilutions of the high QC. This is particularly important if calibrators are prepared via serial dilution of the high standard. Serial dilution of both the QCs and calibrators can mask dilutional linearity issues and should be avoided.Reference Standard</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Reference Standard</title><p id="Par7">Reference standard in PK assays or the positive antibody control stock in the ADA assays must be within expiration at the time of QC preparation. Stability and expiration of the quality controls are independent of the reference material from which they are prepared and should be established separately because QCs are in a matrix different from that of the stock reference standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). Intermediate stocks which are diluted solutions of the reference standard in either the study matrix or a suitable diluent may be prepared, aliquoted, and stored for use in future QC or calibrator production. In such cases, the stability of the intermediate stock covering its storage window, that is from its date of preparation through the date of use, should be established. This may be done by comparing calibrators and/or QCs made from the frozen intermediate stock with those prepared using an original reference standard stock bottle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Qualified Matrix Pool</title><p id="Par8">Proper selection of the matrix used in the preparation of QCs is critical to the quality of the assay and to the prevention of assay drift. This selection is particularly important in the ADA assays where the qualified matrix pool (QMP) is used for negative control (NC) which directly influences the plate-specific cut point. Appropriate screening and selection processes as well as the qualification criteria must be established and clearly defined in the validated test method or in an appropriate SOP. Recommendations for matrix qualification are summarized in the section below.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.</label><p id="Par9">Qualification of the First Matrix Pool</p><p id="Par10">The first QMP is often generated as part of method development and formally qualified during method validation.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par11">Qualify adequate volumes of the QMP to last through multiple studies and phases.

Samples with abnormally high background (e.g., above the PK assay lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) or above the ADA assay estimated cut point) should be excluded from the pool. For ADA assays, an abnormally low background may also be problematic.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">For quantitative PK assays, evaluate the spiked matrix samples for acceptance as defined in the test method or the laboratory SOP; relative error (RE) within &#x000b1;&#x02009;20% for acceptance of spiked matrix samples is recommended. It is recommended that individual matrix samples are spiked at a level between LLOQ and low QC (LQC) in a minimum of one run.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">For ADA assays, the importance of the blank signal (NC) must be emphasized. When no comparator lots are available as is the case with the first lot, it is recommended that individual matrix samples are evaluated in a Tier 1 (screen) assay and their raw responses assessed through comparison with the responses within their panel. All individual matrix samples with abnormally high or low response should be excluded from the replacement pool. Wherever possible, the matrix pool should also be compared against a panel of disease state matrix samples for its suitability.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">Example acceptance criteria for the pool background for a quantitative PK assay may be matrix response 2&#x02013;3 folds lower than that of the estimated LLOQ.

Analytical recovery (AR) of the reference standard in both existing and replacement lots of matrix should be within 80 to 120%.

An alternative approach may be direct examination of the signal-to-noise (S/N) of each individual matrix sample; the matrix samples which are above the validated cut point factor should be excluded from the replacement QMP. The following are the recommended acceptance criteria for the replacement QMP: replacement matrix lot response should be within &#x000b1;&#x02009;10% of the existing matrix lot response, and if not, an assessment should be performed where a panel of individual matrix samples are compared for positive/negative screen outcome against two plate-specific cut points.

Subsequent troubleshooting should follow the order above: first prepare a new batch of QCs, and if repeat preparation fails, qualify a new lot of QMP and subsequently repeat the PC and NC preparation. If PC and NC are still outside their signal ranges, re-evaluate the established signal ranges by including additional data from in-study runs.

In the subtractive approach, the concentration associated with the matrix blank is deducted from the measured concentrations of QCs before QC values are reported. In the additive approach, the measured concentration of the matrix blank is added to the spike concentration of the QC to establish its adjusted nominal value. Marcelletti <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>) presented several case studies involving direct comparison of spiked recovery results using additive and subtractive approaches where recoveries of a number of biomarkers with appreciable endogenous target levels were evaluated. Based on these published case studies, subtraction is the preferred approach, and addition is discouraged. It is recommended that a minimum of 3 sets of matrix blank samples are included in each run and their mean measured concentration used for the adjusted value computations. It is recommended that QCs with endogenous analyte be qualified in a minimum of 30 runs over 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;days by a minimum of 2 analysts using &#x02265;&#x02009;3 sets of QCs per run.

The appropriate specifications for such determinations are assay-specific and must be established as part of pre-study method validation. QCs are to be prepared by spiking the stock into a pre-qualified matrix pool or an appropriate diluent at specified dilutions. The mean measured value for each QC from all passing runs would set the nominal concentration of that QC. It is recommended that a minimum of 30 acceptable runs, performed over 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;days by a minimum of 2 analysts are used to set the nominal concentration of the QCs. Each run is to include &#x02265;&#x02009;3 sets of QCs. Following the initial determination, the recommended criteria for acceptance of QCs in daily assay runs as well as for the qualification of future replacement QC lots is &#x000b1;&#x02009;20% of established nominal value. The observed concentration of any replacement lot must be within this established range. Due to the inherent variability associated with serum- and plasma-derived factors, it may be necessary to assign a temporary nominal value to each QC level based on the initial 20 to 30 run data and subsequently re-evaluate the suitability of this nominal value as additional data become available. In case of assays with such inherent variability, the QC acceptance ranges may need to be re-assessed and re-established periodically. The General Run Acceptance Requirements for quantitative PK assays stated above must also be met.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Qualification of QCs with Dissimilar Nominal <italic>vs</italic>. Measured Units</title><p id="Par58">Enzymatic activity assays are amongst those in which the nominal and measured QC values have different units. In these assays, the nominal (spike) concentration of the enzyme drug is typically provided in ng/mL or &#x003bc;g/mL; whereas, the measured value of the spiked QC sample is in activity units of nmol/h/mL or nmol/h/&#x003bc;g. Such disparity in units poses a unique challenge in the qualification of QCs as it does not allow for the computation of accuracy. In these cases, the limitation may be overcome by establishing a nominal activity value for the QC. The nominal QC activity value for each level can be established based on the mean measured activity from a minimum of 30 acceptable runs, by a minimum of 2 analysts over a minimum of 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;days. A minimum of 3 sets of QCs should be included in each run.

Sondag <italic>et al.</italic> and Schofield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>) have also recommended the incorporation of lifecycle management for assays. Laboratories are responsible for developing internal guidelines for assay trending. Such guidelines should be defined <italic>a priori</italic> to prevent in-study issues; statistical process control (SPC) is essential to achieving this goal. Combining graphical and statistical tools in QC trending is recommended. Trending should ideally start as early as pre-study validation, or otherwise no later than with the first bioanalytical study. The 2018 FDA Bioanalytical guidance has addressed the need for monitoring the performance of QCs as well as for evaluating the underlying causes of any drift, although no monitoring guidelines have been provided by the agency. It should be noted that CLIA-specific trending recommendations have been provided by the agency, and to an extent, they are also applicable to LBAs as CLIA also calls for multiple runs with multiple QC sets over multiple days and by multiple analysts. QC trending may be real-time or indirect; Scherder and Giacoletti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>) have discussed the difference between the two approaches. Most SPC tools are designed to detect shifts early enough so that appropriate corrective actions may be devised and implemented.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical Process Control</title><p id="Par71">Statistical Process Control is a QC trending methodology for ensuring that a system continuously operates as intended.

This means that every source of variability in the process must be understood. QC charts are used to monitor unexpected variations and shifts (appearance of a systematic bias) in the process. Control charts are helpful in identifying unwanted assay events provided that anomalous results could be correlated with alterations to assay parameters (a different diluent lot, matrix lot, or analyst.)</p><p id="Par78">The main types of control charts used in QC trending are run charts, Xbar-R charts, and individual control charts of the group mean (run charts on mean).</p><p id="Par79">Run charts are the simplest in which every trending measurement is plotted. A run chart is usually combined with a moving-range chart that presents the difference from one measurement to the next.

Another common type of control chart is the Xbar-R chart. This chart type presents the trend in terms of average and range of each group. The control limits for such charts are built based on intra-assay variability, making them less suitable for LBA QC trending. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> is an example of Xbar-R chart. This figure is also a demonstration of how these chart types may lead to false alarms. An alternative to Xbar-R chart would be an individual control chart where the plotted values are the average of each assay; these are run charts on mean. In contrast to the Xbar-R charts, control limits for run charts on mean are calculated based on the inter-assay variability. It is still useful to add an Xbar-R chart to the run chart on mean to monitor the intra-assay variability trend.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Example of a Levey-Jennings chart.

Alternatively, Bayesian statistics may be applied to allow the calculation of the predictive distribution of quality control samples in method validation and beyond. Statistical experts may be consulted in the early stages of trending to establish preliminary control limits. Once sufficient data are available to accurately estimate sigma (e.g., at least 30 measurements over at least 10 to 12&#x000a0;months), advanced methodologies may no longer be necessary, and &#x000b1;&#x02009;3 sigma limits could be applied. Control limits should then be re-assessed regularly until a higher number of data points (e.g., 90) is available.

Ranges are calculated statistically using the cumulative mean QC values from pre-study validation runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>) to define the upper control limit (UCL) and the lower control limit (LCL) of the positive controls as mean &#x000b1; 3 sigma, and the upper limit of the NC as mean + 2.33 sigma. One might also consider limits that would afford a 1% failure rate for PCs. The 1% failure rate would not necessarily lead to the assay rejection considering that both PCs at a given level have to fail to result in run failure. ADA QC performance may be trended against these ranges. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> presents examples of ADA PC performance trending over time.

In the absence of true reference standards, accuracy for biomarker assays should only be referred to as relative accuracy. Note that the contribution from the endogenous analyte may need to be factored in where applicable.

Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref> shows a similar example of a measured value plot against run ID using laboratory data from an altogether different assay where two distinct shifts were observed in QCs. The first shift was observed with QCMH and QC47/12 at Run 72 where there was a change in the reagent lot, and the second, at Run 125 when yet another reagent lot change was implemented. In this latter case, QCMH (a commercial QC material) values returned to previous levels after Run 125, but QC47/12 (an in-house serum pool) values were lower than ever observed. The shift at Run 125 triggered an internal investigation which led to the identification of a manufacturing change in the solid phase coating antibody lot.

Other cross evaluation methods which involve assessing existing and replacement QCs against one calibration curve are also helpful although not as informative as the first methodology.</p><p id="Par131">The following are key in not only reliable trending but also in detection of drift<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par132">A properly qualified matrix pool&#x02014;the validated test method should clearly define assessment design and acceptance criteria for the qualification of a replacement matrix pool (Qualified Matrix Pool section).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par133">Appropriate number of runs&#x02014;helpful in minimizing variability (1, 2, and Qualification of QCs section).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par134">Adequate/appropriate number QC sets per run&#x02014;most agency guidance as well as a multitude of lead publications have offered recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par135">Appropriate positional variability&#x02014;place QCs in the upper left and lower right quartiles of the microtiter plate or adequately and appropriately in the beginning and end of the run (Using Lever-Jennings Principles to Trend QC Performance in Ligand Binding Assays).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par136">Introduction of conditions that bring about variability early in method development and during pre-study validation: different analysts, different days, multiple mini-scale preparations all intended to capture variability factors.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="Par137">Successful management of ligand binding assay life cycle is demonstrated through achievement of consistency in the performance of assay quality controls. As QCs are critical monitoring tools, it is important that laboratories establish standard procedures for their preparation, qualification, and performance trending. This publication has aimed to provide guidelines and best practices pertaining to LBA QCs on subject matters not addressed by regulatory agencies and at the same time, to establish consensus within the bioanalytical community. The authors have presented methodologies for the qualification of replacement QC lots as well as offered practical approaches to trending LBA QC performance. This paper has additionally addressed a variety of questions regarding handling and management of QCs and serves as a reference document for bioanalytical laboratories.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><sec id="Sec29"><p>
