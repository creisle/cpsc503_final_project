We analyzed individual target lesions (iTLs) of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) to determine differences in TS dynamics by using the ClassIfication Clustering of Individual Lesions (CICIL) methodology. Results from subgroup analyses comparing genetic mutations and TS metrics were assessed and applied to survival analyses. Data from four mCRC clinical studies were analyzed (1781 patients, 6369 iTLs). CICIL was used to assess differences in lesion TS dynamics within a tissue (intra-class) or across different tissues (inter-class). First, lesions were automatically classified based on their location. Cross-correlation coefficients (CCs) determined if each pair of lesions followed similar or opposite dynamics. Finally, CCs were grouped by using the K-means clustering method. Heterogeneity in tumor dynamics was lower in the intra-class analysis than in the inter-class analysis for patients receiving cetuximab. More tumor heterogeneity was found in KRAS mutated patients compared to KRAS wild-type (KRASwt) patients and when using sum of longest diameters <italic>versus</italic> sum of products of diameters. Tumor heterogeneity quantified as the median patient&#x02019;s CC was found to be a predictor of overall survival (OS) (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.44, 95% CI 1.08&#x02013;1.92), especially in KRASwt patients. Intra- and inter-tumor tissue heterogeneities were assessed with CICIL. Derived metrics of heterogeneity were found to be a predictor of OS time. Considering differences between lesions&#x02019; TS dynamics could improve oncology models in favor of a better prediction of OS.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1208/s12248-020-0434-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>cetuximab</kwd><kwd>individual tumor lesion dynamics</kwd><kwd>machine-learning</kwd><kwd>metastatic colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>survival analysis</kwd><kwd>tumor size modeling</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="Par2">Model-Informed Drug Discovery and Development (MID3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>) has demonstrated its usefulness to improve drug development in several cases, including the oncology area and the modeling of tumor size (TS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). TS is often expressed as the sum of longest diameters (SLD) of the individual tumor lesions (iTLs) measurable and defined as &#x0201c;target lesions&#x0201d; at baseline, as described by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Each patient presents multiple iTLs, which can be primary or metastatic and located in several organs or tissues. This means that all tumor lesions, regardless of their location and status, are reduced to this single SLD value, also called the total TS, at each assessment visit within a patient. The iTLs are assessed throughout the clinical study; the SLD is derived at each time point and then categorized to quantify the tumor response to the treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Observed or model-derived TS metrics, such as the early tumor shrinkage (ETS, relative reduction of total TS at certain time points) or time to tumor growth, have been shown to be predictors of overall survival (OS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">As an oversimplifying measure of cancer progression, the use of total TS may cause a loss of information with respect to tumor heterogeneity that could carry valuable information to predict disease progression, drug efficacy, and OS accurately. Indeed, differences in iTLs dynamics could reflect tumor heterogeneity: tumor lesions may present several clones which evolve in a Darwinian process at different rates, showing different phenotypes and drug resistances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Tumor heterogeneity is one of the factors involved in tumor resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>) and tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Recently, some modeling works in the oncology area successfully included tumor heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>) and related this lesions&#x02019; variability to OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Not including tumor heterogeneity into TS models may hide iTLs resistance development or other differences in response to treatment. This is not only due to the different clonal phenotypes but also due to the different tumor microenvironments in which the lesion has appeared.</p><p id="Par4">In a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>), the analysis of iTLs was performed to assess differences in lesions dynamics by using the Classification Clustering of Individual Lesions (CICIL) methodology, which integrates knowledge from signal processing and machine learning (ML). Results were used to then inform decisions about building a longitudinal model for iTLs or for total TS. The work presented in this paper continues and expands the innovative approach started by Terranova <italic>et al.</italic> by applying CICIL to four clinical studies in which cetuximab was administered in different combination therapies. TS data from these studies were analyzed either to assess the iTL dynamics between different organs or anatomic regions or to determine tumor dynamics differences within an organ or tissue. Furthermore, several comparisons between groups of patients based on differences in gene mutations and tumor metrics were performed. The impact of tumor heterogeneity on the clinical outcome was also assessed.</p><p id="Par5">The objectives of this work were as follows: (i) to determine tumor heterogeneity in lesion dynamics using iTLs, (ii) to compare iTLs dynamics from patients based on genetic mutations (KRAS) and different TS metrics, and (iii) to apply these results in survival analyses of considered clinical trials.</p><p id="Par6">This approach was applied to four metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) clinical studies. CRC is any kind of cancer which affects the colon or rectum. More than 1.8 million new cases and 881,000 deaths related to CRC were estimated to occur in 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). If only mCRC is considered, the main therapy for many years was 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with folinic acid (FA). This therapy regimen showed a poor response rate (20%) and a median OS of about 6&#x000a0;months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). Newer chemotherapy drugs, like irinotecan and oxaliplatin, improved the response rate to 31&#x02013;34% and the median OS to approximately 24&#x000a0;months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Monoclonal antibodies have provided new weapons to fight mCRC. One of them is cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The EGFR is involved in survival, proliferation, tumor invasion, and tumor immune evasion. It has been observed that patients with <italic>RAS</italic> mutations, including mutations of the <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic> genes, present poorer response to EGFR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>) such as cetuximab, which is the drug studied in this work.

At baseline, iTLs were defined as measurable lesions representative of all involved organs, with a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total. According to studies protocols, the same method of assessment and the same imaging technique was used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and at each subsequent imaging time point. In the CRYSTAL, 045, and OPUS studies, iTLs were bidimensionally evaluated by using the modified WHO criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>), which quantifies the total TS by measuring the longest and perpendicular diameters of iTLs and then, deriving the so-called SOPD, sums of the products of diameters. In APEC, the assessment of response was performed according to RECIST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>) which uses the sum of longest diameters SLD of iTLs as a measure of total TS. Thus, unidimensional measurements were collected for iTLs in APEC, while bidimensional measurements were available for the other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>). In addition to the recorded TS measures over time, information about the lesion site was collected for all iTLs as text in the case report form for all studies. The lesion type was also coded as follows: primary, metastatic, or node. Calculated SLD or SOPD of lesions selected as target lesions and the recorded information on non-target lesions and new lesions were used to derive response and progression outcomes throughout the studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dataset Preprocessing</title><p id="Par10">iTL data from the four clinical studies was extracted from the clinical database. Patients with only the tumor assessment at baseline as well as tumor data measured after tumor surgery procedures were excluded from the analysis. The main CICIL analyses presented in this work used the longest diameter as a single TS metric being available across all studies. In the three studies having bidimensional measures of TS available for each iTL, CICIL was re-run for comparisons of results with the two metrics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>CICIL Methodology</title><p id="Par11">The previously developed CICIL methodology, implemented in a Java-based platform, was used to evaluate the similarities or differences between iTL dynamics (inter-organs or intra-organ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). This methodology consists of 3 steps: (i) iTLs are classified based on their location and type described by expert physicians, (ii) cross-correlation (CC) values are estimated to assess the degree of similarity between dynamics of two lesions, and (iii) similar cross-correlation values are automatically grouped into clusters using the K-means clustering method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). This approach can be easily applied to either the bi-dimensional product (WHO criteria), the longest diameter (RECIST criteria) or any future emergent volumetric measurement provided by progresses in tumor imaging and/or tumor size collection. Thus, we could analyze lesion sizes regardless of tumor evaluation criteria for diagnosis of progression of disease adopted in the studies.</p><p id="Par12">Two kinds of CICIL analyses were performed: inter-class analysis and intra-class analysis. On one hand, the inter-class analysis uses the sum of lesions TS within each patient&#x02019;s individual organs defined in the CICIL classification. They are called class-related target lesions (cTLs). Therefore, each patient shows a single cTL for each organ/tissue. Then, the CC value of the pairs of cTLs the patient presents with is computed to assess the difference in lesion dynamics between organs or tissues. This analysis then includes only patients presenting iTLs in more than one tissue. On the other hand, the intra-class analysis uses the iTLs from a single organ or tissue to compute the CC values for the pairs of iTLs in that organ or tissue. This is performed to determine the differences in lesion dynamics between iTLs within the same patient&#x02019;s individual organ or tissue. Only patients presenting more than one iTL within the same organ are included in the analysis of that specific class. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows an overview of the CICIL methodology.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CICIL methodology overview. Clinical trials present in their case-report forms (CRFs) information about tumor size, time, tumor location, and tumor type of individual tumor lesions (iTLs). This data can be used to classify these iTLs. Then, the degree of similarity between the time-course of those lesions in a patient can be computed with the cross-correlation, both between lesions belonging to different classes (cTLs, inter-class) and between iTLs within a class (intra-class). Similar cross-correlation coefficients (CCs) are grouped by applying the k-means clustering technique to find differences between groups of CCs</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12248_2020_434_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Step 1: Rule-Based Classification</title><p id="Par13">iTLs were classified according to the same methods described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>), which were defined for two other mCRC clinical studies<italic>.</italic> Several keywords were defined for each class in the classification text file of CICIL. These were based on the recorded tumor location and anatomical and physiological features observed on tumor lesions of these organs. The CICIL platform performed the automated classification process by recognizing the defined keywords and locations of each lesion in the extracted clinical dataset. Before running the classifier tool, missing or wrong organ information was checked (and corrected, if needed) during dataset preprocessing. Lesions with missing organ information were classified in the general &#x0201c;Unclassified lesions&#x0201d; class.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Step 2: Cross-correlation Analysis</title><p id="Par14">In order to automatically compare hundreds of TS dynamics, while keeping information on the lesion dynamics across the whole study, the non-parametric comparison of two TS time courses, treated as time series, was performed by estimating the CC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). The CC values can range from &#x02212;&#x02009;1 to 1. CC values equal or close to 1 indicate similar tumor dynamics for the two compared lesions. CC values equal or close to &#x02212;&#x02009;1 indicate opposite profiles. In contrast, CC values close to 0 indicate undefined relationships (i.e., not distinguishable) or small trends towards similarity or difference depending on the sign and absolute value of the CC. Thus, the CC value obtained from two TS dynamics was used as a metric of similarity or difference between such lesion dynamics.</p><p id="Par15">CC values were calculated without accounting for any delay between TS dynamics (zero-time shift) as well as at shifting one of the lesions over the other (and vice versa) in time to maximize their CC value. The number of assessments per lesion allowed us to check up to 12 time shifts in both directions. Details on CC calculations are reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Step 3: K-Means Clustering</title><p id="Par16">K-means clustering is a ML unsupervised clustering technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). As the last step of CICIL, this method was used to group the different CC values into clusters. Then, differences between these groups or clusters could be assessed based on the centroid value (the average CC value of each cluster) and the percentage of lesion comparisons (i.e., CCs) and patients in each cluster. Two arbitrary cutoffs were established for easy interpretation of results: clusters with centroids below &#x02212;&#x02009;0.35 were considered as an indication of different lesion dynamics, whereas those with centroids above 0.35 were considered as pointing to similar dynamics. Clusters with values in between were considered as suggesting undefined relationships.</p><p id="Par17">Beforehand, the number of clusters was selected with the elbow method which allows to assess and then choose the smaller number of clusters having a lower sum of squared errors (SSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). If SSE <italic>versus</italic> the number of clusters were plotted, the arm would be the plotted line and the elbow would correspond to the optimal number of clusters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Survival Analysis</title><p id="Par18">Overall survival time data were extracted from the four studies in order to perform survival analyses and to assess whether results from the CICIL analyses could be used as predictors of survival time. Kaplan-Meier plots were obtained, log-rank tests were computed, and a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to the data. One of the tested predictors was the median CC for the inter-class analysis, which was computed for each cetuximab arm patient as the median of CC values at zero-time shifts obtained from the different lesion pairs (e.g., liver-lung or liver-node) within a patient. Given its relationship with patients&#x02019; response, the KRAS status was also tested as a predictor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Software</title><p id="Par19">Dataset preprocessing was carried out in R version 3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>) by importing the clinical SAS&#x000ae; dataset with the function <italic>read_sas</italic> from the package <italic>haven</italic> 2.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>).

These predictors had been already selected in a previous internal analysis based on total TS, and they were found to be statistically significant. The patient median CC value was added on top of this multivariate Cox model, both as a continuous and as a binary variable, to test its statistical significance as a predictor of risk. Results for the model containing the continuous median CC variable showed statistical significance for all predictors, except for the KRAS status which was significant in the univariate analysis but dropped from the final models (<italic>p</italic> value &#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). The <italic>p</italic> value of the median CC was 0.006 with hazard ratio (HR) of 0.74 (95% CI 0.60&#x02013;0.92). This indicates that a CC value increase of one unit (e.g., from &#x02212;&#x02009;0.5 to 0.5, thus reducing tumor heterogeneity) would lead to a decrease in the risk of death of 26%. Although the KRAS status itself was not significant, the addition of an interaction term between the KRAS status and the continuous median CC resulted to be significant (<italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.022) and suggested that the effect of our heterogeneity measure was less pronounced in KRASmut patients with an average increase of the risk in this patient population by 60%. If median CC was introduced into the multivariate Cox model as a categorized binary variable reflecting the two groups (median CC above or equal to/below 0.35), the same predictors were significant. The median CC presented a HR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.08&#x02013;1.92, <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.012) for the group equal to or below 0.35 (i.e., more tumor heterogeneity). These results are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b and c</xref>. This means that patients with the median CC equal to or below 0.35 presented an average 44% increase in the risk of death. Of note, the lack of significance of KRAS status in the multivariate analysis was true only on this reduced CICIL analysis set which included only subjects having the median CC available (i.e., iTLs in more than one class). Indeed, <italic>p</italic> values smaller than 0.001 were obtained when running the analysis on all patients (including those without the median CC).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="Par36">Despite enriching data analysis in oncology, lesion heterogeneity has been often ignored or disregarded in the TS modeling, as also highlighted by the limited number of published works in this field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). This is due to the complex models and methods needed to consider differences between organs or tissues, as well as the intra-tumor heterogeneity within an anatomic area. Models with such features are complex and computationally expensive. Thus, being able to efficiently assess and quantify the heterogeneity in iTLs TS dynamics prior to any modeling analysis is extremely valuable to inform and to guide the best modeling strategies. The recently proposed CICIL methodology addressed this objective by exploiting ML techniques to inform subsequent modeling steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). This approach provides a user-friendly and automated framework to quantify heterogeneity in tumor dynamics at different levels: (i) between iTLs within an organ and (ii) between lesions located in different tissues. Results can be used to make data-driven modeling decisions, for example, about the use of total TS <italic>versus</italic> iTLs TS, and about the level (within or across tissues) of tumor heterogeneity to be accounted for in the model.</p><p id="Par37">In this work, we used CICIL to analyze TS data of patients&#x02019; iTLs from four mCRC studies investigating cetuximab treatment. The classification of iTLs considered the three main lesion classes &#x0201c;Liver&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Lung&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Lymph node&#x0201d;, and the general class &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d;. The low number of iTLs for the least frequent classes (i.e., &#x0201c;Other respiratory organs&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Other digestive organs&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Other specified organs&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Primary lesions&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Unclassified lesions&#x0201d;) did not allow us to assess intra-tumor heterogeneity in those classes separately and they had to be pooled into a single class called &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d;. Results indicated that the majority of iTLs were located in the liver (68%). Liver was also the most representative class in a previous analysis of two other cetuximab mCRC clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). This is in line with available literature highlighting the liver as the most common site of metastasis in mCRC patients due to its anatomical position with respect to the portal circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">CICIL results from the intra-class analysis indicated little intra-tumor heterogeneity in TS dynamics of patients&#x02019; iTLs from the same classified tissue (less than 23% of iTL pairs at zero-time shift across the three main classes). Such results were obtained with a rich dataset including 863 patients and 2990 iTLs across studies which supports the robustness of the conclusions. Thus, we considered it conceivable to neglect intra-tumor heterogeneity in subsequent subgroup analyses performed in this work.</p><p id="Par39">In the inter-class analysis, tumor heterogeneity between lesions located in different tissues (cTLs) was found to be higher. In particular, in the analysis based on the cetuximab arm, 36% of CCs or cTLs pairs (from 38% of patients) were found to follow different TS dynamics at zero-time shifts. This percentage is also marginally larger than the one (35% lesion pairs from 30 to 35% patients) obtained in a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>), and it is mainly driven by the CRYSTAL study (44% lesion pairs from 45% patients) as the largest study in this work. When time shifts were considered, such percentage of CCs dropped to 13%. This points to the possibility that time delays could account for some of the observed tumor heterogeneity in the patient, e.g., a delayed response to the drug in some tumor tissues. It should be noted that in both analyses some patients presented iTLs with only two TS assessments, which made their CCs not as informative as those coming from lesions with more than two TS measurements.</p><p id="Par40">Cetuximab patients with cTLs expressing KRASwt genetics showed less tumor heterogeneity in TS dynamics than KRASmut patients. Cetuximab, as an EGFR inhibitor monoclonal antibody, presents lower efficacy if lesions present with KRAS mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). Therefore, we may relate this increased tumor heterogeneity in KRASmut patients to their reduced response to Cetuximab.</p><p id="Par41">For those studies that measured the longest diameter and the perpendicular one, inter-class results obtained with the longest diameter were compared to those using the product of diameters as TS metric. The combined analysis from the pooled dataset did not suggest any differences between results obtained with SOPD and SLD metrics. Nevertheless, results for the CRYSTAL study showed smaller differences in cTL dynamics and then in tumor heterogeneity when SOPD was used as the TS metric (38% with SOPD <italic>vs</italic> 45% with SLD). This may point to a better characterization of tumor heterogeneity when bidimensional data are collected for this case study. Indeed, literature shows that such differences between TS metrics depend on the kind of cancer: in some cases, there are no differences between unidimensional or bidimensional measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>), while in other cases, there are significant differences between results obtained with these two metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">Tumor heterogeneity results obtained in the inter-class analysis were found to be a predictor variable of OS time in the form of median CC. Its significance was proven both alone (log-rank test and the Kaplan-Meier plot) and in combination with other known risk predictors (multivariate Cox proportional hazards model). Increased risk of death with increased heterogeneity was suggested by all tested models. Interestingly, the model including a significant interaction term between the heterogeneity metric and the KRAS status suggested a relevant decrease of risk (about 40%) with decreased heterogeneity in KRASwt patients, but a small decrease (about 3%) in KRASmut patients. This points to a reduced impact of heterogeneity in TS dynamics on risk for KRASmut patients which is however already associated with a lower treatment effect in this subpopulation. Pharmacokinetic-tumor size-overall survival relationships can be affected by immortal time and selection bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>), in particular, in situations without dose-ranging data. As the estimation of our tumor heterogeneity measure is related to the number of tumor assessments the patient had over the study and this depends on the immortal time, the potential for immortal bias cannot be excluded. More sophisticated models including time-dependent covariates allowing a change in status over time may be tested in future works to overcome the potential for immortal time bias.</p><p id="Par43">As one of the major outcomes of this work, such results further highlight the impact of tumor heterogeneity on tumor response and the importance of including it into survival analyses. Besides, modeling in the oncology arena could benefit from including measures of tumor heterogeneity data such as CC values. For example, the use of &#x0201c;tissue-agnostic&#x0201d; datasets in which individual lesions are considered and grouped based on the degree of similarity in their TS dynamics could improve the performance of TS models in favor of a better prediction of OS time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p id="Par44">The CICIL outcome obtained from a large dataset of tumor measures was assessed with respect to different factors (genetic mutations, tumor metrics), and its direct link with a clinical endpoint was quantified. Comparisons between KRASwt and KRASmut patients indicated less heterogeneity in tumor lesions dynamics in the KRASwt subgroup which is known to well respond to Cetuximab treatment. The method used to measure the lesion TS did not lead to different results except for the single-study analysis of CRYSTAL where an apparent heterogeneity was compensated and reduced when including the perpendicular diameter and obtaining the SOPD. An increased risk of death with increased heterogeneity was suggested by all tested models, especially in KRASwt patients. A reduced impact of heterogeneity in TS dynamics on risk for KRASmut patients was indicated.</p><p id="Par45">The identification of a new metric of tumor heterogeneity related to a clinical outcome as OS is a relevant finding in the exploration of TS metrics that can inform clinical development decisions. This further supports the use of continuous TS response metrics as endpoints in early clinical oncology studies in order to improve design efficiency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
