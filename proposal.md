## March 16 - Project proposal due -  class presentation + questions (5 mins ) - (7 mins for group)

You're submitting a proposal, not a specification - it's natural that your plans will change somewhat as you refine your ideas. But your proposal should be based on an idea that we've discussed and I've approved.

### Research Proposal format: your writeup should be 1-2 pages and include:

* description of the research problem you are targeting, summarizing
    the 5-10 papers which will represent your key references

* description and justification of your contribution. Examples of possible contributions: Do you plan  to improve on a proposed solution by using a possibly more effective technique? by combining multiple techniques? Or are you proposing a novel different solution?  Or maybe you are planning to apply a technique which has been used for nlp taskA to a different nlp taskB.  .... Are you proposing to apply a technique to a different dataset or to a different language? ...Are you proposing a different evaluation measure?
    
* description of the dataset (corpus) you are going to use in training/testing your model. Make sure that whatever corpus you need you can get access to it. If you do not need any corpus explain why that is the case.
* description of how you are going to evaluate your work. If you are not going to perform any evaluation of your work, justify why this is not feasible in the time frame alloted and present a plan of how you would perform an evaluation if you had more time.

Your presentation should be based on the writeup. However, remember that this is intended for your classmates (not for me) . And they had no previous exposure to your ideas. You will not have much time so focus on key points
